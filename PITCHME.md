---

An impatient longing

For Permanence.

Not for the beginning of a new pleasure.

But to reach The End

Of all a man's concerns.

---

Modernity,

In all its varied forms,

Leads to the dissolution of the human species.

---

When No One is home,

One is always At Home.

---

Society and its band of instructors

Tell you what you "should do."

The Truth lies in

what Must Happen.

---

A man is What he is.

He is Where he is.

Whatever he is

Wherever he is,

If no desire to be something other,

If no celebration of who/where he is,

He is in a place of Truth.

(Not to be celebrated)

---

All things arrive

When one needs them not.

They arrive, when he is not searching for them.

The phone rings, when it is not being watched.

After one receives,

After the phone rings,

The pleasure fades.

He returns to needing.

Nature returns to giving

Once his need fades.

---

Wisdom lies in seeking Understanding

Rather than betterment.

---

Where there is no like, or dislike

Where there is no opinion

Where there is neither hope, nor fear

Where there is neither This, or That

There is Nothing.

Where there is Nothing

There is only the infinite expanse

Of Truth.

---

The Student, prepares for life

The Master, prepares for death.

---

Of what use will this Life have been

If one does not find Truth.

How can a man find Truth

If he does not devote his Life to it.

How can he devote his Life to it

If his heart, his spleen, his liver do not long for it.

---

To sincerely seek The End of all things

Is the True Beginning

Of a man’s Life.

---

Thing do not "get better."

They stay the same, in different ways.

---

You have been told of monkey mind.

Methodologies you have been given, such as meditation, mindfulness and various others

Do not cure monkey mind.

Before asking "what to do"

Recognizing this fact, as verified by your own experience

Must become a visceral understanding.

---

Nature has plans for a human.

The human has his own.

Freedom lies in a genuine indifference

To both.

---

Discussions and debates ride upon a foundation of ego.

A luxurious expression of dearly-held beliefs and opinions, rather than a quiet and sincere movement toward Truth.

All beliefs, all opinions, and all conclusions

Are a celebration of ego

And a flee from Truth.

---

Seek not "the best."

Seek The Only.

---

The traditional way is always Untruth

The majority view is always Untruth

The "certified" instructor is always Untruth

This stands to reason

For the humans it comprises are not Devoted to Truth.

Truth is always from the Beyond

Truth is always

From Wild and Untamed Humans.

---

The desire to attract the eyes of the world

Wholly incapacitates

The blossoming of The Art.

---

You will spend many decades upon this Earth.

In all of this time, you would be greatly fortunate to encounter but One person who is Rare and truly Serious/Sincere.

This provides a great Freedom.

The Freedom from worrying about what anyone thinks.

For all but One

Is worth it.

---

The world could applaud you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for all your life.

It would not be enough to satisfy you.

You could perform penance and spiritual/self-help prescriptions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

It would not be enough to make you Realized or Free.

---

Is This the way it always will be?

This is This

Because That is That.

This is not altered through This.

It is altered through That.

The alteration occurs of its own accord

When This

Is no longer bearable.


---

The Perfectly lived life, is not of happiness

But of Emptiness.

---

Siddha Secret: Greatness

Greatness

Resides not in the X's and the O's.

Resides not in the form and the technique.

Resides not in aphorism and psychology.

Greatness resides

In the Devotion.

Greatness resides

In the true desire to learn the cracked code of The Mind.

---

What would be the nature of your daily existence, if your actions were not motivated by pleasure.

This is a Question that a Serious Human may wish to consider.

---

Village lives

Sun and moon-centered lives

Farming lives

Are pure and natural forms of living.

---

Every field that you have a vested interest in

From finance to medicine to performance to homebuilding

Has ONE Brilliant Genius.

Who has escaped the lies of his industry.

And will give you The Truth.

Scour the world to find Him.

Why would you possibly settle for less?

---

All of life's Elixirs are available to a Human.

But through Devotion

Rather than prescription.

---

It is a Joy to aid the Serious.

To provide for them a Haven

In a world that has forsaken them

And caters to the unserious.

---

If a man attempts to force himself

To become Serious

To become Sincere

This is Untruth.

To Arrive at the Truths of life

To Arrive at a command over the Majesty of the Mind

To Arrive at anything Otherworldly

Is theoretically available to All

But Practically, to the Few.

---

There is no time.

There is no time.

There is no time.

There is no time.

There is no time.

Understand . . . 

There is no time.

---

You are not worthy of condemnation.

No matter who you are

No matter what you have done.

All things revert to an equilibrium.

---

 Either a man has Arrived

Or he has not.

There is no "progress."

---

Only a fool

Is proud of his accomplishments.

---

Patience is a virtue

Of the Unserious.

---

It is all about the journey, not the destination:

For he who seeks improvement, rather than Arrival.

---

The problem is Not that society has lied to you.

For barking dogs and laughing hyenas know no better.

The problem is that you have imbibed the lies so completely

That you do not recognize them

As a problem.

---

There may be ONE Human in the entire Twitter universe

Who is truly Ready for the messages released in this account.

(If you have already begun trying to figure out who that ONE is, this is proof positive that it is not you).

---

The Wise man does not tempt life

With either excitement or pride.

---

The purgatory between what IS

And what he would like it to be

Through desire

Or guilt.

This is the life of a human being.

---

What humans have done IN the world

Is inspiring.

What humans have done TO the world

Is frightening.

---

World Class comes not from hard work.

But from a Sincere desire

To be World Class.

---

A Sincere Human

Must arrive at the Truth as to whether he longs for Freedom or Pain.

---

When losing Everything becomes acceptable,

Gaining Everything becomes possible.

---

Gazing through a window

Into glistening trees, and distant shadows.

The entire episode that comprises a man's "life"

Is created is housed within The Mind.

There is no man's "life"

There is no "man."

There are only . . .

Glistening trees

And distant shadows.

---

All of a man's problems

Can come to an end this very evening.

This is the power

Of the Truth.


The Thought-less state . . .

---

Pure.

Uncompromise.

Spontaneous flash.

Channeling.

Raw.

Absolute.

Divine.

Thought-less.

TRUTH.

---

Problems:

Answers perpetuate them.

Truth solves them.

---

Things that begin Pure

Invariably become commercialized, certified, diluted, and bastardized

Until neither the purity, or the effectiveness, remains.

Truly Rare Gems

Preserve their Purity at all costs.

A shining Beacon on a Hill

In the flea-market of commerce.

---

Whatever a man seeks to achieve in his life

There is a Specific Truth that guarantees that particular achievement.

---

To genuinely not know

Is a genuine Beginning.

---

Human association

Invariably leads to pain.

---

Truth.

Total Freedom.

An End to all pain.

Is a practical and attainable reality

In this very lifetime.

For the one who weeps for Truth

And vomits at the sight of prescriptions.

May these words reach

The One.

---

We do not truly see what we Have

Until memories reveal

What we Had.


Our personalities

Have robbed us of our lives.


How can a man who has glimpsed a drop of The Truth

Possibly stand "tall and proud."


Wise is he

Who sees just how deeply he has been consumed

By nonsense.


The only way that a man can know what no man has ever known

Is if he seeks what no man has ever sought.

---

The deeper a man’s longing for Freedom and Truth

The more impatient, and the more receptive, he will be to learn their true source.

---

Man's problem is not that he is unhappy

His problem is that the propensity to Chase, the addiction to Opinion, and the habit of Prescription

Are overwhelmingly more attractive to him

Than never-ending Peace.

---

The Truth is there are but a small handful of humans on Twitter

Who will genuinely benefit from the words that appear on this account.

The remainder have the birthright to do so

But ego, belief, a lack of self-honesty, and a need for validation

Incapacitate this birthright.

---

Humans are not accustomed to being spoken-to as Humans.

They are accustomed to being spoken to as invalids in need of cheering up, and being improved.

---

When a man enters the front door

Awakens from slumber

Or breaks from work

His Mind and his Limbs race toward a particular Thing.

Whatever this Thing may be for a particular human

This is his True Allegiance

Whatever his lips may say.

---

A man hires, associates with, and recruits

Precisely those activities and humans

That support his disingenuousness

And thrive within his set of insecurities.

---

There is nothing more joyous to the lips, than speaking Truth.

And nothing more painful to the ears, than hearing it.

---

A few select humans are Transforming.

Seeing through eyes that have opened for the first time in their lives.

This is not a reason for excitement.

They are not "good" for having done so.

Simply a Quiet Effect

Of exposure to Truth.

---

A moment not lived in Freedom

Is a dead segment of life.

---

The war worth fighting

Is the war against one’s Insincerity.

---

If one seeks No Limitations

He must first have No Excuses.

---

Do not settle in

Do not grow roots

Do not create attachments

Do not covet money and things.

For your time in this foreign land

Is soon to be over.

---

Only Untruth

Can be Commercial.

---

All roles that a human plays

No matter how sanctified and ostensibly sacred they may be

Produce only anxiety and failure.

This is because

Every role is a Lie.

--- 

There are maybe a few hundred to a few thousand Humans in the entire world population

Who are Ready to receive The Truth.

---

Virtually all Humans lie to themselves every moment of the day and night

This is perfectly acceptable to them.

---

Spirituality, pooja, satsang, retreats, religions, austerities, and self-help

Are mass entertainments.

---

The attempt to “help” any human

Arises from ego

And ends in futility.

---

There is no greater fool

Than the one who chases happiness.

There is no greater idiot

Than the one who attempts to find it in society and its people.

---

Look at what society and your “circle”

Has done to you.

---

He who has “faith” in humanity

Need only speak to the first ten people he meets in the street, or on Twitter.

Or the first hundred

Or thousand

Or million

Or hundred million

Or billion . . .

---

This world has nothing to offer.

Its people are predictable and uninspiring.

Circumstances are circular and joyless.

A cacophony of voices and noises.

A traveling circus of cardboard props and neon lights.

This world

Has nothing to offer

The Sincere and Serious human.

---

Truth lies in seeing the emptiness behind all pursuits

The fraudulence of “helpers”

The impotence of methods

The ashes that manufacture self image.

---

Strangers make more peaceful companions

Than acquaintances.

---

You will never be happy.

One cannot be something

That does not fundamentally exist.

---

Life, it must be known,

Is capable of things one cannot imagine.

Placing one’s trust in it

Is a catastrophe in the making.

---

WHAT ARE YOU DOING

Examine what you are doing.

So habitual you have become,

That you do not examine.

See what you are doing.

It WILL surprise you.

---

A man's opinions are nonsense.

His beliefs are nonsense.

His thoughts are nonsense.

His entire life settles and moves upon the foundation of this nonsense.

A Sincere man

Grows tired of his very own voice.

---

The reason that you are not Silent

Is because you are under the insidious notion

That you know something.

---

The human who Sees the hopeless irreversibility of his conditioning

And the depths of his artificiality and ignorance

May live to escape it.

---

He who attempts to make you happy

Perpetuates your suffering.

---

Moderation is a lie sold to the masses.

Truth

Lives in the Extremes.

---

The most damaging addiction

Is Hope.

---

The insincere and ignorant pursue "improvement" and "feeling better."

The Sincere and the Wise pursue Truth.

---

For you who speak empty platitudes, reply with bumper-sticker quotes, happiness, be strong, love/love/love, all is one, be this, do that . . .

I wonder if your drivel ever stops you in mid-speech.

If you ever feel the tinge of shame for your unseriousness.

Responses allowed.

---

A man's life is entirely wasted in the pursuit of being viewed as

Good

and

Smart.

---

Every person in your life

Is hindering you

In ways that you will never come to know.

---

A Summary Of Man's Life:

Babble nonsense to nobodies.

Pleasure chase for rewards.

Adorn his ego.

Ingest intoxicating substances.

Practice self-help techniques.

Have conflicts with self and others.

Have an unrestful sleep.

Wake up, repeat.

Die in mid-action.

---

In a TRUE world,

The Unserious human

The Insincere human

Would be a pariah.

A shunned and ignored and marginalized faction.

In the world we currently live,

He is the centerpiece,

The one who is catered-to,

And this is why this society breeds

More of "them."

---

Every effort

Moves one further from Truth and Transformation.

---

The trouble with being around “people”

Is that one develops a need for them.

---

Man succumbs to death but once.

To Life, he succumbs each and every day.

---

Everything is genuinely possible for you.

But your opinions and beliefs exempt you from this possibility.

---

There is not a person on this Earth

That will be as reliable as you would like them to be.

---

You will tend to like another

More than they like you.

---

Each excitement

Has a cost.

---

The more faith you place in humans

The harder you will fall.

---

On your way home, after speaking in a group setting

You feel a tinge of embarrassment for what you said

And the bite of fear for how you may have been perceived.

---

No matter how promisingly different a particular person seems to be

They, sooner or later, turn out to be like all the rest.

---

After all these years, you find that your life has become

Something you could not have possibly imagined.

---

You long endlessly

For the fateful day that happiness finds you.

---

You feel completely alone.

You do everything possible to convince yourself that it is not true.

---

The Obscure long for the future.

The Famous yearn for the past.

---

Never in your life

Have you ever been Enough.

---

You are intimately tied to the belief

That tomorrow will be better than today.

---

You make excuses for those who do not reciprocate

Because the alternative is not something you are ready to bare.

---

There is no Divinity

In personhood.

---

 A human lives so many lies.

So many fractures he is manually holding together.

---

Every human being in your life judges you in some way

Is unreliable to you in some way

Hurts you in some way.

Every. Single. One.

What this demonstrates is not that humans are “bad.”

But that a “human” cannot be your faith, fulcrum, or foundation.
