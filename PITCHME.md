"Spending your life exactly the way you wish to spend it is a wonderful liberation."

~from "Atmamun" by @KapilGuptaMD

---

Unfortunately, this is what sometimes happens when I choose to take Questions 

Q: What do I do? 
A: The secret is located 4 steps right, and two steps forward 
Q: Do I walk or drive? Left foot first? Or right one? What stride? How big are these "steps?"

Addicted to prescriptions.

---

I will only tell you this: Even if every person in the world approved of you, precisely to the degree and specifications that you dictated One week later You would be lost in another form of anxiety.
    
---

Twitter Q: What is the difference between desire and attachment? How can you want something and not be attached to receiving it?

Twitter A: One can desire all he wants. But if he holds his possessions and his accomplishments loosely, he is not imprisoned by them.

---

The mind can do anything it wishes to the man it possesses.

Anything

Whenever it likes, it can tease him, assault him, enrage him, or make him anxious, worried, and afraid. 

Man believes that he is in the control of his life. That he is the one who makes his decisions. 

How preposterous.

I will happily give you the secrets of the universe. But if you imbibe them as a prescription, they will create nothing but problems for you. 

The key to all things is the pursuit of Visceral Understanding.

But the man has been taught to "think". And he has become prideful in this very ability. 

It is for this reason that he can not experience the Truth.

---

All Conflict is Self-Conflict

---

Life is not about: 
- Enjoyment. Never lasts 
- Pleasure. Never satisfies 
- Family. An extension of the ego 
- Spiritual Austerities. Prescriptions that lead to themselves 
- Success. A chase for empty things 
- Life is about Arriving so completely That one experiences no Thought And no Need.

---

I have spent my life and my career creating Questions 
Questions that seep into the bloodstream 
Questions that spawn Transformations 
Questions that create Cures
I will now share with you a Question to ask your child: "What is it that I have never really understood about you?"

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you know if what you are doing is the best thing you should be doing, or closest to the best?

@moyinho20 The source from which it arises.
The results that it brings

---

@KapilGuptaMD I hear the truths you speak of, yet nothing in my life has changed. What will it take for me to really absorb these truths?
@bren__1996 The removal of the artificial space that exists between the teaching and the realization

---

Le No Mind pourrait se rapprocher du "Tranquility of the mind" des Stoic called "Ataraxia" ou du "Nirvana" Budhiste

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you find the thing/activity/passion to devote yourself to? Do you think you simply stumble upon it?
@BobStocks11 It tends to already exist within you
Something that comes easy to you, though it may not appear to be a "profession" at first or second glance.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Yesterday I arrived. For the entirety of the day, there were no thoughts to be found. 

I tasted what it meant to have perfect action. 

Today I find myself “trying.” it is a subtle shift in what I can only describe as my ecosystem. 

Where will I find the permanence I seek?

@ArtplusCrypto Keeping score will keep you imprisoned to seeking.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What must one understand in order to need nothing from anyone or anything?
@LamarDealMaker A clear sight of the continual experience of Need producing havoc in one's life

---

@KapilGuptaMD I feel stuck in the middle of feeling the emotions of guilt/fear/pain/discouragement yet also seeing that these emotions are fleeting. I’m comfortable in this middle ground though, to reach the point of my emotions not influencing me, what else must I understand?
@KapilGuptaMD Perhaps I am too loyal to feeling stuck, and need to see through this as well? However seeing through doesn’t cure my emotions, but it does allow me to be less influenced by them for the moment.
@bren__1996 The place from where the understanding arose, find out what this place is
You are fortunate to have found such a place.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Are drugs an unearned shortcut to higher consciousness?
@TYGRproductions For the recreational and the insincere, who seek temporary "experiences"

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do I have an addiction to thinking and resorting to cleverness?
@danielpsegundo It is the only way you have ever known.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is best way to remain unaffected by external circumstances?
@NavinUttam There is no “best way” to anything 

There is only The Truth

One becomes unaffected when he goes on a sincere Journey to see the inner workings of how the mind imprisons him

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sir what was the impetus behind your journey and subsequent realization...was it unbearable misery and suffering?...is that the only trigger for the level of desperation required for the journey? What else can bring about this level of desperation or seriousness?
@iyerkum Many things

Whatever it is, it must have a requisite level of Intensity

It often begins with interest

And grows into obsession.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In no-mind, is there any will? Any conscious effort or decision making? Or do we just sail where intention (if even intention) draws us?
@OndrejSkop In No-Mind, things happen of their own accord

Where will is necessary, it appears

Only to the degree that is necessary

---

@KapilGuptaMD Would you say art is something necessary in every man’s life?
@beyonder_amc Art is man's native tendency.

---

The miracle is not Enlightenment

The miracle is that which compels man to live a life of Suffering.

Man is God

For only a god could create, out of perfectly thin air, a universe full of illusions to imprison himself by.

---

If one creates a thin layer of space

Between himself and his mind

Between himself and every person in his life

He will be able to sustain himself gloriously

In this one, life-saving pocket of air

Amidst the crashing waves of his life.

---

Actions arise from a compulsion

Compulsions arise from a need for pleasure.

At the fundament of it all

The actions that one considers "important"

Are the ones that harbor the most potential for pleasure.

---

Everything, in time, returns to itself

Every straight line

Eventually becomes a circle.

---

The only lasting satisfaction

Is the end of all searches

For satisfaction.

---

Humans does not respond to what you say

They respond to what they hear.

This is because of the history that you have with them

And the insecurities that they harbor.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it necessary to undergo a retreat/an extended period of meditation, if one wants to transform.
@MattVujovic Do this only if you want to ensure that you do not transform.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is a business that serves a social purpose a waste of time?
@bailster88 The social purpose is irrelevant
The genuineness behind it can be beneficial.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Are wants/cravings/desires ever visceral or is it always mind playing tricks?
@former_jr Good question.

The desire to be free of all desires can liberate

But, so long as it is not a way to find pleasure (Pleasure from the fact that one has conquered desire)

---

If you decide to give, give with no strings attached. Not because this is “noble” or “compassionate.” But because the freedom from expectation will save you ten lifetimes of torment

---
Post de dnim_on sur Twitter 

Realization:
My tendency to overachieve and my desire to become a "success" stems from my desire for approval and admiration.
My desire for approval and admiration stems from my mom only paying attention to me when I accomplished something.
(My father was absent since 7)

Realization:
Doing X feels like "hard work" because I don't have genuine desire or curiosity in X.
I chose to learn X to get rich and become a "success".
So in essence, even my career decisions have been directed by my inner discontent.

Realization:
Nothing about myself is permanent.
Many of my 'personality traits' are just conditioned reactions based on pains and fears of the past. 
What I considered my 'self' is actually a cobbled together structure of illusory beliefs, built on shifting sands.

What have been the consequences of these realizations?
A profound sense of peace.
A sense of peace I've rarely, if ever, felt before.
Disturbances do come up during the day, but I approach them with a desire for clarity and understanding of the root cause.

I wasted years reading popular self-help and psychology books.
I wasted years trying to fix my issues with mental/emotional techniques and exercises.
I meditated 20-30 minutes almost every day for 4 years.
None of these things ever got me to the place I am now.

In closing, 
I am thankful to @KapilGuptaMD for pointing me towards the way to Freedom.
And to others who read his words, may they break through the barrier of your intellect and reach your Heart.
It took me a year to finally start my Journey

---

If I recall, I discussed in my first book, Atmamun
That if a man surrenders himself whole to a god, it would serve him greatly.
The Truth is, who or what a man surrenders himself to is irrelevant
It is the very separation of him from himself that sets him free

Whether a man surrenders himself to the universe
Or to a benevolent god
He will have the weight of life lifted from his shoulders

---

Thought creates the prison cell of man

The walls, the cement floor, and the bars

Within the cell is a window through which one sees the sky and the trees, a place of happiness and freedom

Thought creates this as well

Ultimate Freedom lies in No-Thought.

---

Man cannot make a decision

Without second-guessing himself.

For decisions are made by the intellect

And the intellect, no matter how well-informed

Can never be certain.

---

This is the problem with us human beings. Receiving something is not enough. Becoming something is not enough. Feeling something is not enough. No matter how grand or majestic that thing may be, we must spoil it with reason. We must graffiti our logic across its sacred presence.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you recognize the face of truth?
@thedreamcarver Non-intellectual feeling.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do I fear of criticism? Not just of being criticised by people I love and care about, but even by random strangers online. It's the thing that blocks me most from acting in resonance with my truth.
@made_in_cosmos An honest question
A human being's persona is patched together with papier-mache and band-aids.
A criticism threatens the entire structure
No sooner does she see the sword of criticism
That she turns it against herself
This is why she fears it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why are we ultimately alone?
@Simpatiko One experiences Life from within oneself
One may be in good company
But one is always Alone.

---

@KapilGuptaMD You mentioned recently you were inspired by Buddha and his approach to enlightenment. Can you name another figure who you have found inspirational and why. Thank you.
@LaoTouThinking Miyamoto Musashi
Sincerity
Purity
Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Where have you witnessed pure action?
@russshanahan Any action that does not arise from Thought.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How can I cut out those things in my life holding me back?
Cellphone use, media consumption, foods with negative effects
Also, how does finding a girlfriend/boyfriend function in the life you suggest

@vincenthardaker It is only once the pain of being held back is greater than the pleasure of distraction that change will occur.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I live a peaceful life of solitude most of the time.
Sometimes I feel the urge to have the pleasures of the world.
I become unhappy and don't recognize myself anymore.
Can one obtain a state of perpetual inner peace?

@1sandiego1 This will happen once the pleasures become less and less pleasurable.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I plan a lot (to the point of perfection) but fear and doubt to take over right before first steps. Remedy?
@Gobigorgodown It is fear that gives rise to the planning.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sincerely, how do you know that all of your Truths are objectively, 100% true? Where do you find this certainty
@tj_dozier7 Non-intellectual Knowing.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to stop procrastinating?
Namaste 
@leejamali Largely an insincere question
A serious pursuit would be to find something in one's life about which he does not procrastinate

(Settle in for a long search).

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you trust your discernment is taking you on the path of evolution & not devolution? Is the complete lack of emotion, in arriving at a decision, make it the ‘correct’ one?
@abhih10 Forceful repression of emotion, no.
Dispassion, yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the way to dispassion?
@npankaj365 Innocent exploration of the dead-ends of all pleasurable pursuits.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do I eliminate personal fear?
@Kranzthor Where there is desire, there is fear.

---

The human who is interested in "practices"

Society has many tricks, techniques, and options for him.

The human who is interested in Arrival

Society has nothing to offer him.

---

Blaming another brings problems
Blaming yourself brings problems
Needing another brings problems 
Pretending not to need them brings problems 
Being selfish brings problems 
Being benevolent brings problems
Doing something or nothing brings problems 

Understanding is Freedom.

The Master is busy Seeing

The novice is busy Doing.

 Daniel Kahneman and Herbert Simon on Intuition — "Our intuition is more often right if: 1. The environment is unchanging or slow to change; 2. Complex adaptive systems are poor places to develop intuition; and 3. We have a large sample size. That is, we get a lot of practice. We receive immediate and accurate feedback."

xx

 Your Intuition Is Wrong, Unless These 3 Conditions Are Met — "The first is that there has to be some regularity in the world that someone can pick up and learn ... The second condition for accurate intuition is “a lot of practice,” according to Kahneman. And the third condition is immediate feedback. Kahneman said that “you have to know almost immediately whether you got it right or got it wrong.” When those three kinds of conditions are satisfied, people can develop expert intuition

---

"Man’s greatest folly lies in believing that something cannot happen unless he himself does it

Yet the movements of the planets seek not his permission nor his expertise

And his very life lies in the hands of a heart that functions independently of him"

---

"For the secret that man does not know is that he pursues the hard, out of a longing for the Soft

He pursues action, out of a longing for Sight

He accumulates, out of a longing for Emptiness

He pursues the intellect, out of a longing for Art."

---

@BettyBuckley If you wish to achieve the state of No-Mind, the rest of your life must be devoted to the Mastery of living This Moment.

---

Understand this Truth: An action that is a reaction is not a True action. It is a non-action. And a non-action must result in problems.

---

You have heard about being "dispassionate" about your product

It doesn't mean don't care

@JeffBezos said it best, "Anybody who doesn’t change their mind a lot is dramatically underestimating the complexity of the world.”

Being dispassionate implies intellectual flexibility

x

Kapil Replying to @BrianNorgard @JeffBezos
You have spoken the greatest Truth in the world. But perhaps spoken too lightly, my friend

You so deftly hold up a stone, without revealing that it is the Hope Diamond

You have discovered a lost pilot, without revealing it is Amelia Earhart

Dispassion is the Holy Grail of Man.

x
Agreed. I've always called bullshit on people telling me to find my passion. Do work. Enjoy it all.

xx

Passion and addiction are very similar. Passion is what we call obsession we approve of. Addiction is what we call obsession we disapprove of.

x

"Find your passion" campaign  had good intentions I believe but in a age where people lack self awareness and rely on social validation more than ever, it became "do what people would applaud you for"


---

The technical aspect of one’s art, sport, craft, or business Is NEVER where the money is. Literally and figuratively.
x
I don’t understand what he’s saying. Can you explain?
x
That the part of you which is/could be a bit of a capitalist isn't the same part that is the artist. It's basically the same idea as the core concept behind the book "The E-Myth" by Michael Gerber which is essential reading for any business owner/entrepreneur
x
Analogy: I really love to fish. So I want to make a living from it. Ultimately this means I'll need a trawler and be able to run a team in rough seas as well as run a business. Clearly not what I love about fishing and I ultimately hate fishing now

Thought creates the situation
Thought creates the problems
Thought creates the deficiencies

Thought creates the happiness
Thought creates the despair

Thought creates the Thinker.

Siddha Secret: Epiphanies

The thing about Epiphanies . . .

The reason they do not last . . .

Is because the Mind creates excitement about having discovered it

So that it may use this excitement to cleverly whisk one away from the epiphany

Back into the Mind

---

One cannot truly let go of the past
Until
He let’s go of the very idea of the past.

The Present 
So swiftly becomes the past 
That by the time one looks for it 
It is gone.

Everything that a human being sees
Is history unfolding before his eyes.
It has already died
What remains visible are the skeletal remains

---

Replying to 
@KapilGuptaMD
I’m not Serious enough. Still allow things and thoughts to distract me. Why is that happen?

It is not in your hands to Disallow.

@BobStocks11
Could you explain further? I have had the same feeling with my own thoughts. I have not conquered them but I want my life to be free from them entirely.

Is it more about existing with the thoughts than trying to stop them?

Freedom comes from a disappearance of need.

Replying to 
@KapilGuptaMD
What is stopping the pleasure-seeker (me) from actually realizing that chasing pleasure is a fruitless pursuit?

Experience

Examination

Sincerity.

@NethersTheorem
A tangential follow-up:
I feel like I really am sincere and honest with myself. If it was actually the case that I was, then by your account, I would have arrived at all my answers. . .
Why do I feel sincere if I am in reality not?

You "think" you are sincere
But you do not "feel" it.

---

Replying to 
@KapilGuptaMD
I get curious about multiple things. There are too many things to do. How do I know which thing to pursue with full dedication?


The one you find yourself returning to.

---

Replying to 
@KapilGuptaMD
Why do I face so much internal resistance to the point of self sabotage when trying to let go of things that don’t serve me anymore?

Because they still do, in fact, serve you.
Thank you, it was right in front of my face but I was unable to see.

---

Replying to 
@KapilGuptaMD
How come people who are in lower positions in an organisation's hierarchy are harsher / more strict about applying rules than the ones higher up? That's something I experience in my company. Can't see why most do that. Am guilty of it too.. thanks

Good question.
It is a pattern with human beings that the "common" are the most insecure. They become intoxicated by their title, and this becomes their new identity


---

Put another way, man’s life is a snow globe. The globe is the mind. And man’s entire life sits enclosed within it.

The glass is clear. Through it he can see the sun, the moon, and the stars. But he does not see the glass that separates himself from it.

He believes that he speaks. But, in fact, his words are not his own. The mind speaks for him.

It is for this reason that he reacts.

You see, a man cannot see. Because the blindfold that he wears is painted by the greatest artist in the world. The painting is so realistic that few in the history of human civilization have identified it to be a fake.

No matter what this man does in his life, from trying new things to thinking differently to getting therapy to taking medications to gathering opinions from others and so on . . .

He will be doing all of it within the snow globe of the mind.

Understand this: His life occurs in the snow globe. His problems arise in the snow globe. And every one of his treatments are also in the snow globe.

Each time he thinks he has “progressed,” he has simply moved to a different part of the snow globe.

The most inspiring feature of nature is The Great Mountain 
It is unaffected by nature’s wrath 
It is serene, regardless of the moon or the season 
It is uncompromising to all of earth’s creatures 
It asks not 
It takes not 
It simply stands tall
As an inspirational possibility.

De Naval

Q. What do YOU think is the purpose of life?
A. To experience life.

Q. What is your favorite quote? 🙂
A. “Desire is suffering.”

Q. Why do we sometimes turn deaf to our intuitions?
A. Desire.

Q. How to create long lasting relationships ?
A. Just be you and wait for the people who want that.

Q. How many hours a week do you work?
A. My definition of work is “the set of things that you have to do that you don’t want to do.” So maybe a 5-10 hours a week.

Q.  Top 5 books that have enlightened you?
A. Too many. But read Osho, Krishnamurti, DeMello, Michael Singer, and Kapil Gupta.

Q. What if a decision isnt a Y/N, but a bit more complex than that? Eg: What if there are 2 probabilistically equal paths A & B. How do you choose between them?
A.
• If you can’t decide, the answer is no.
• If two equally difficult paths, choose the one more painful in the short term (pain avoidance is creating an illusion of equality).
• Choose the path that leaves you more equanimous in the long term.

Q. How do you spend your free time? And what you consider your free time being?
A. I don’t have free time because I don’t have unfree time. Everybody and everything that had a claim on my time has been uncompromisingly removed from my life.

Q. Favorite fiction book(s)?
A. Jorge Luis Borges’ “Ficciones.”

Q. How did you hone your discernment for when to be patient vs. when to be impatient?
A. Impatience with actions, patience with results.

Q. Do you have a morning routine? What does it look like?
A. 1 hour meditation + 1 hour workout / yoga.
Qb. Would you mind sharing your meditation practice?
Ab. Sit and make no effort, surrender, and accept whatever happens. 1 hour at waking and 30-60m in the early evening. 60 days for real effect. YMMV.
Qc. Do you experience the day (time) longer compared to before as a result of meditation?
Ac. Not directly due to the sitting meditation. But non-judgmental awareness helps more in that regard.

Q. Tried Wim Hof breathing and cold exposure methods?
A. Yes, interesting but too hard to sustain for me.

@KapilGuptaMD By its very Nature,

a plant grows towards the sunlight,
a bee pollinates flowers,
a woodpecker pecks wood. . .

What does the human, in it’s Natural state, do?

@NethersTheorem That which he does when he is not mesmerized by Thought.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What about our bodies? Do we have to take care of it? Or does he knows how to keep us alive and healty?

@emsagahon The body takes care of itself
Unless inappropriately acted upon by habits learned from society.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I want to improve myself. However, I also want to be content with myself. How can I improve myself while still remaining content with who I am?

@productite Self-improvement is a multi-billion-dollar scam

It does not exist.

The only thing that exists

Is Understanding.

---

- "The real doing is a non-doing. The ultimate action is understanding. The ultimate action is recognition. Seeing is the ultimate doing. Seeing is more doing than any possible doing you could do."

- "A fact of human nature, which is that unless a human being is required to do something, he wont."
    - Unless a human's back is against the wall, unless he feels a consequence, he will not be compelled to do anything other than what is most instinctive and readily available to him/her
    - "No human being acts unless there is a consequence

---

"Most human beings will never be content with who we are"

  - "You can't be content, with something you don't understand, or something that's always changing"
    - "How can you be content with a moving target?"
  - "To be content with who you are, basically means to be content with who you think you are, and who you think you are is just a bunch of personality traits"
    - Those personality traits change based on who you meet in the street
    - "Who you believe you are is constantly changing, the mind is like the weather"
  - "If you do not want to live a miserable life, what must be understood is that the pursuit of any prescription, will absolutely cement your misery"
    - Whenever you try to "fix" something, you only perpetuate it
    - Most things are not "fixable", they're only "seeable"
    - Fixing is manipulation, and whenever you manipulate something you may fix one side, but ruin another side

---

Be wary of reading for knowledge. For this knowledge will die with you. If something is of utilitarian value for a particular pursuit, this is useful. If you read in order to pad your intellect, in anticipation of sounding intelligent at social gatherings, both you and the one who is listening to you will have created yet another opportunity for experiencing a hollow evening. The one who is not burdened by knowing, but is Invested with Wisdom, takes the flight of the eagle. He soars through the heavens throughout his time on earth.

---

Excitement and Pleasure

            The impetus for your every action. The action that is done without excitement, pleasure, regret, or strife is an action that has a chance of providing satisfaction. Any silvery thing that awaits you on the horizon is a mirage. Every “tomorrow” is, and will always be, empty. This one statement will either set one on a lifelong chase to verify it. Or it will save him decades of torment. Whichever way you may choose to go, do not “believe” me.

Uncompromise

            To halves Never make anyone whole.

What a man can accomplish by Caring Pales in comparison To what he can accomplish by Not Caring At All.

---

If you had only one or two years to live, no one would be ‘managing’ anything. People would seek CURES. The reason that we manage things, is because we know and we feel, rightly or wrongly, correctly or incorrectly, that we’re going to be here for a long time

---

Behind every action is a reactivity

A reactive attempt to avoid pain

Or attract pleasure.

Thus, all motivations be they positive or negative

Arise from an impure seed.

A Pure Action

Is thought-less, reason-less, and intention-less

It arises from a place beyond The Mind.

---

It is only when a human being becomes whole within himself, that he is good to himself or to any other human being.

It is only when he genuinely arrives at a place of needing nothing or no one that he is able to receive without pleasure, or to give without hope.

What a human seeks above all else in this life is Freedom.

And this freedom can only be provided by one thing, and one thing only:

The Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the most important thing a person must learn in life?
@Antertera A wise question.

That he does not exist.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you know something is the truth?
@arnej247365 The mind becomes silent.

---

A realization that changes Everything

Is that Pleasure,

Including even the pleasure of being loved,

Is simply not worth

A life of torment.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Fear paralyzes me from taking action.

Do I need to develop more courage in order to not be overwhelmed by fear?

Or is the only way out is Understanding the self does not exist?

Namaste.


@BobStocks11 By the time a man is 40

He has seen everything this life has to offer

The years beyond this are redundancies

And a life spent in nostalgia and regrets.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one find something that excites him and can feed himself/family?
@ShamblesCo Begin with your hobbies

--- 

@KapilGuptaMD Are emotions thoughts?
@former_jr Emotions arise from thoughts

---

@KapilGuptaMD Fear paralyzes me from taking action.

Do I need to develop more courage in order to not be overwhelmed by fear?

Or is the only way out is Understanding the self does not exist?

Namaste.

@aman_ramnani Fear will not paralyze when one finds something he cannot live without

(If you fire off another question, you will not have heard this response).

---

@KapilGuptaMD what is sincerity for the truth?
@harrydry Seriousness.

---

The Buddhists, unfortunately, are not serious

They have trivialized the purity of this Sincere Indian Sage

They have reduced his teachings into prescriptions

And settled for a life of "discipleship."

They have reduced the most inspiring man I have ever known

Into an "ism."

---

One of the essential myths that lead humans astray – the need to become happy
“Happiness, sadness, joy and misery, are all the same”
Why? – They only exist in relation to each other (they’re interdependent)
“There would be no need for happiness if there was no misery”
“Because they are interdependent, they cannot survive in their own soil”
When one thing requires another, it doesn’t in fact exist – It is only a reaction to (aka it is spawned by).
Something that is real/true, exists in its own domain – “It depends on no one, and nothing”

---

“I think it’s the wind that blows…a knock on the door…a clapping of ones hands. Anything and everything that has nothing at all to do with the intellect. That is life.”
“Anything at all that does not involve the domain of thought and thinking, or strategizing or intentionality, or wanting to achieve, or hoping to provide, or desiring to gain, or needing to give….where there are not even the seeds of rules, where there isn’t even the shadow of hope. Where what is, is. And there is no opinion about what is.”

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the difference between humans and other animals?  If thinking is the cause if human suffering, are animals who can't think better than humans at living?
@omkarishere Infinitely

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is most important for emotional well being- contentment, fulfillment or a compelling future?
@MarkIacolina Understanding that your problems can never be solved
Because the person to whom they are happening does not exist.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How can one discern if they have found the Truth, or if they need to dig deeper?
@Kairon01 One's interiority grows serene.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one find their vocation/calling?
@atakan_yz Forget about your calling
Marry financial sustainability with something you find it easy to lose yourself in.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is it that I reflexively get mad at my younger brothers for trivial things that I wouldn’t get mad at a stranger or even a close friend for?
@NethersTheorem You are not attached to strangers.


---

@KapilGuptaMD My sincere question is this: Where does the desire to impress others come from? Why is it so strong and prevalent?

@geeta_jetley No achievement in your life will lead to Satisfaction

---

The world passes each other feel-good messages while sitting in one spot for their entire lives

They do this in order to give themselves the illusion of movement

So that they may secretly remain where they are.

---

The reason that we waste time is because Living Life is very low on our list of priorities.

And Living Routines is very high on the list.

---

As a man approaches the precipice of Wisdom,

Books contain nothing but blank pages

Philosophies are intellectual procrastinations

Religions are based upon the fear of god

Society is an external manifestation of the chaos that is mind

And Nothingness is the greatest Truth.

---

There is no greater evidence of man's inner sorrows

Than the ubiquitousness of alcohol.

---

Fame loses its luster

Wealth loses its novelty

Privileged circles lose their charm

Success loses its excitement.

What remains

Is the glorious pursuit of losing oneself

And forgetting oneself.

This never loses its charm.

This is the Highest of Arts.

@KapilGuptaMD How does one gain the confidence to lead others?

There will come a time when I will leave @Twitter
 
There will come a time when I will leave this world.

If there is anything you must learn

It is this:

Devote yourself to seeing the way things Truly Are

Seek not the reactive paths of happiness and pleasure

---

Siddha Secret: BOREDOM

Boredom is not a problem to be treated

It is a sign to be understood.

A sign of the Mind's perpetual craving for pleasure.


---

Art is the only domain in which a human is free to be the one whom society has never allowed him or her to be.

It is for this very reason

That Art is Truth.

---

If one cancels his journal subscriptions

Surrenders his certifications

Burns his books

Says goodbye to his "friends"

Fires his instructors and mentors

Avoids conferences and meetings like the plague

And cares not a drop what the world thinks of him

He will become a Master.

To Those Who Are Subscribing To My Private Discourses:

1) There is a waiting list

2) The numbers have gotten out of hand. There cannot be this many Truly Serious humans in the world
3) If you do not have money, or are not willing to take out a loan, you are not serious enough. Do not apply. There is nothing more futile than free advice

4) In your application letter, be direct, truthful, and sincere
5) If the amount that you pledge does not pain you, you will not have enough skin in the game to Transform

6) I must acknowledge that many of the letters I receive have been heartfelt and Sincere. I understand your pain and your plight. Life is indeed suffering
7) I do not need or accept disciples

8) If you do not pay your invoices on time, you will forfeit your spot to the next person on the waiting list. Once forfeited, it is gone forever

9) This is a place for the 0.000001 percent. There are no compromises. For there is no time
10) Do not send me questions. Firstly, I receive too many emails to respond. Second, even if I did not, questions are intellectual. Thus, you will not truly hear the response
11) If you find yourself wondering if the Private Discourses are "worth it," the answer is No, they are not. They are not for you. It would not be wise of you to apply
12) The Private Discourses are written in a state of No-Mind. It is essentially, "writing in tongues." I do not remember what I write. It is, thus, of no use to ask me a question about what I have written. For when you ask me this question, I will have moved on from that state.
I will post additional things as they come to mind.

@KapilGuptaMD How can one deal with insecurity? If insecurity is eliminated, one would not have the need to live in the past or be afraid of future. Correct?

@KarthikMallavar Not living in the past for future

Is not what you really want

It is an idea that you are loosely attempting to toy with because you believe it to be "right" or "healthy" or "spiritual"


---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one find the craft they wish to devote their life to?

@jimmpierce Begin with your hobbies

---

@KapilGuptaMD Can someone live in solitude (trying to become  legend) while having a job and a family?

@emsagahon You are asking for rules

There are none.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why am I afraid to see the truth even though I want to?

@JorgeGlezGmz Because something inside you realizes that it will shatter the orderly existence you have created for yourself.


---

@KapilGuptaMD I long to feel in the moment as that’s when I’m best, but feel frustrated I cannot get there with ease. I try to see past the frustration, then I begin to doubt if I have the DNA. I’m still very attached and very in the mind. Am I at all closer to Truth?

@bren__1996 Yes

These are wise realizations.

@KapilGuptaMD And is it that I retreat away from the Truth when I allow myself to feel frustrated instead of attempting to see through throws emotions?

@bren__1996 You are viewing it too mechanically

Must be genuine desire

Which requires no prescription

---

@KapilGuptaMD Since understanding is action, right attention and effort must naturally follow.  I don't believe in techniques, but I am interested in clearly understanding.  What do you recommend for one who wants to see their predicament clearly?

@rishiwashere That if one is painfully honest with himself about how he feels

It incapacitates the Mind.

---

A human lives perfectly and performs perfectly when he is Clear

He is clear when he has no self-concept.

---

The Truth is Not that one must become content with what he has. It is the realization that nothing that he has can bring contentment

--- 

To Be ELITE

  - It's not about figuring out what you can do to perform better, it's about realizing what the problems, or the things you haven't realized, are, that have hampered your performance
    - The former may make you 5% better
    - But the latter has the potential to blow the doors open& by way of understanding

---

The Nature of Your Fears Have Consequences 

  - "If you're afraid of losing, or not becoming a success, then you'll go down the path of hard work and struggle. But, if you're afraid of not learning the absolute truth, and that's what you're truly afraid of&how good you could have been&then you'll go down the path of mastery."

The Master's greatest mistake

Is in attempting to convince the unconvincable

And reach

The unreachable.

He must come to peace with the fact that,

As difficult as it is to see humans walk the path of destruction,

Only an infinitesimal few

Are Ready for The Truth.

@KapilGuptaMD Is it possible for the master to cause a hesitation along the path of destruction for the non-seeker enough so that the non-seeker may become the seeker?

@JamesTEshleman Yes
If the non-seeker has arrived at true Seriousness/Sincerity.

---

The highest realization of a Seeker

Is that he is afraid of Finding.

For this Finding

Will rob him of the pretense to seek

And of the wholly familiar, and painstakingly-created, image of being a “seeker.”

---


The path of striving and achievement leads only to endless frustration

Pure Mastery of craft and of Mind

Is the only sustainable joy and satisfaction.

---

The only things you should believe are the things that don't require belief, and those are your own direct experiences

---

- "It is foolish to try and bring a human being out of his miseries, because of the implicit belief that the person wants to be relieved of his miseries"
    - "There is great pleasure in misery"
      - Where there is misery, there is comfort - it's home for many of us

---

"Responsibility" is a societal construct

It is an idea that is Forced upon a human

As are all Rules.

That which is done authentically

That which has no name attached to it

That which is not an ideal that one is attempting to live up to,

Has Power

And creates a True Impact.

---

Siddha Truth: Self
Where there is a Me
There will be a My.
It cannot be otherwise.

What comes
Always goes.
This is what I have learned.

---

The humm of the air conditioner
The splashing of a water droplet
The sound of a bird’s beak against the hollow trunk of an oak
These are the greatest Truths.

---

As I sit in a high-back chair

Peering across the Great Forest that unfolds outside my window

I examine the Nature of Desire

And what I find is not that desire is inherently good or evil

Rather, the evil lies in the Effects that overcome a man

When this desire is unfulfilled.

Definition Of A "Scholar":

One who confines knowledge to the air-tight compartment of his intellect

So that he may prevent it from entering his bloodstream.

94 percent of the things that are done in a company

Like 94 percent of the things that are done in professional athletics

Are a function of neither strategy, nor productivity, nor necessity, nor art

They are a function of Anxiety.

The same can be said of Religion.

For the religious do not Love God

As much as they Fear him.

---

The path of Competition

Is the path of Anxiety.

It cannot be otherwise.

---

In order to create a company 

That is unlike any in the history of human civilization

It must be an Autocracy.

---

There is a subtle presence within a human that remains unaffected by anything that may happen to him.

This is what he must access, if he seeks to become Free.

THE TRUTH About Motivation

1) The thing that humans being seek most isn't happiness

2) It isn't success

3) It isn't money

4) It is that which is at the root of all such things

5) What human beings seek most is Engagement.
6) Each day in a human's life is a restless day

7) He is bored. And anxious. And fearful. And stressed. 

8) And the reason he is all these things, is because he isn't Engaged

9) The days that he is Lost in something are the most treasured days of his life
10) In order for there to be Engagement, there must be a mountain to climb

11) One must be on the precipice of something

12) One must be reaching for something

13) Something whose payoff is magnificent

14) Magnificent enough to keep one Engaged
15) The air around us is filled with time

16) It is filled with an opportunity to create an Everest

17) So that we may have an excuse to become lost in its foothills

18) If we do not, the "devil" comes calling

19) I will leave you with a Great Truth
20) A human is never motivated by the things he "should do"

21) He is motivated by Inspiration

22) He is Inspired by the prospect of achieving something Grand

23) And he is Driven by the belief that it is within his grasp

Namaste.

---

Knowing in one's heart

That nothing or no one is coming

Allows one to become Free, and live in satisfaction.

Hoping in one's mind

That something or someone might come

Keeps one anxious and imprisoned forever.

"Poor audio quality" weeds out the casual, the curious, and the insincere.

If one acquired the ability to never think about himself for the remainder of his lifetime

He would never again be subject to so much as an ounce of emotional turmoil.

---  

@KapilGuptaMD You know someone is doing wrong. They don't see it. You want to help them. How do you approach it? The other person isn't rational enough, and is driven by conditioning.

@becomingGuru In this situation

Your desire to help

Is all about your Need to help

Rather than the other's desire to receive it.

--- 

@KapilGuptaMD I recently started a new job and find myself socially anxious when making conversation with coworkers. My mind tries to think of the next thing to say or remark rather than staying in the moment. Why do I find it so hard to relax and "be myself"?

@maydaytrade Because you are afraid of having to live with the shame you will undoubtedly feel after not "socially performing" to some invented standard.

--- 

@KapilGuptaMD I can’t seem to overcome my ego and that haunts my relationship in my mind, and I can’t seem to communicate how I feel properly. Why is it so important to me even though I know it’s pointless?

@JorgeGlezGmz Intellectual knowing

Is the most pointless thing of all.

--- 

The wise action

In any interpersonal circumstance

Is the action that does not arise from attachment

Or create attachment.

--- 

The decision is Wise

If it does not produce self-conflict.

--- 

Life Satisfaction does not arise from austerities or "working on oneself"

It arises from a Realization of the way things truly are.

This Realization can only enter

Into the one who is more desirous of a Lifetime of Satisfaction

Than a moment of "happiness."

--- 

The child seeks to become an adult

The adult seeks to become a child.

One seeks the world

The other seeks a respite from it.

One seeks a foray into adventure

The other seeks a return to innocence.

One seeks to become something new

The other seeks to become who he once was.

--- 

As one walks a sincere and systematic Journey toward Truth

He experiences Surprises

He suddenly notices that he no longer experience certain anxieties

A keen clarity opens up within him

And because these arrive without effort, prescription, or practice

They never leave him.

--- 

  - "If man wishes to pursue something, because the pursuit gives him the opportunity to lose himself, losing oneself provides a sense of engagement, and engagement provides a sense of freedom from the torture that is his mundane life. THAT is useful."
    - But what he gains from that, the end product, will turn to dust

--- 

There is an intelligence within a human being

That his intellect cannot hope to match.

It is in exploring this mysterious elixir within him

That a human stands witness to,

And gains access to,

His Perfection

And his Genius.

Namaste. 

--- 

Help is Offered

Far more than it is Desired.

--- 

A Journey toward Satisfaction

Rather than pleasure.

A Journey toward Dispassion

Rather than happiness.

A Journey toward Arrival

Rather than practice.

A Journey toward Wisdom

Rather than intelligence.

A Journey to cure all one's human frailties

And become Free.

--- 

WAITING

A human spends his entire life, Waiting.

Waiting to be chosen

Waiting to become successful

Waiting to be validated

Waiting to be loved

Waiting to be reciprocated

Waiting to be happy

Waiting to become content

A human spends his entire life . . . 

Waiting.

The Question that creates A Master:

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

--- 

Man, in true and practical fact,

Creates his own reality.

He will have it just as he sees it.

But in order to see it,

His Mind must be trained in the most secret and delicate of ways.

--- 

What greater regret could possibly arise within a man

Than to realize, in the moments prior to his demise,

The Truth.

Which had he been privy to decades before

His life would have carried no resemblance

To the one that he lived.

--- 

One tries to string together drops of pleasure in order to create an ocean of satisfaction"
      - This does not work

--- 

Hold the world at arm's length

View it as a lovely and sentimental carnival

And the events of your life will not affect you.

--- 

@KapilGuptaMD Your story about your son hitting a hole in one on a prestigious golf course, and how you reacted, was amazing. It was authentic and inspirational. I wondered if you do ever look back at your memories?

@bendon_james The Mind does try to take me there

But I invest myself in The Truth

Which is This Moment

(Non-mechanically. And Non-prescriptively)

--- 

The things that we understand, create Silence

The things that we do not, create Emotion.

--- 

The Truth lives inside of a moment.

This moment is a well-concealed escape hatch in a small corner of the sphere.

THIS . . . is all there is.

--- 

- To avoid mistakes in the future - don't focus on behavior fixes
    - Instead understand the source from which your actions arose 

---

How do you self-assess?

  - "It isn't about being nice to yourself, or critical of yourself, it isn't about what you did and what you should have done instead, it's about understanding why you did what you did and what specifically it was a reaction to" 

---

Happiness and sorrow are the same. Pain and pleasure are the same. There is perhaps no more impactful realization in a man’s life.

---

I think, as a human being, I should have a near-death-experience once per quarter

---

Each person has to reach and declare their non-negotiables, the thing(s) they cannot do or cannot keep from doing

---

To arrive at not caring what ANYONE thinks about you, not even your own family or your own kids, not your spouse, not your boss, not your audience, not your fans, not the media, to not reactively but to genuinely arrive at that place inside yourself because you no longer have to put on a face, that's an enormous milestone in a human being's life

---

The Master watched his every action

As if watching an animal in the wild.

He examined his patterns

As if examining the movements of the sun and the stars.

In tracing them back to their source,

He discovered his true motivations.



His motivations revealed his beliefs

His beliefs revealed the untruths upon which they rested.

In seeing these untruths,

He arrived at The Truth.

In arriving at The Truth,

He became . . . 

A Master.

---

When one seeks The Truth

He moves from a curiosity and a wonder about the world

Toward a contempt for the world

Culminating in an indifference to the world.

@KapilGuptaMD How do you access instant understanding of a specific skill or craft that you have a strong and sincere desire to learn?

@KapilGuptaMD You once said to go on an innocent Journey, you need to be an innocent warrior, which means you follow your heart and leave your Mind behind.

What realization allows one to proceed with leaving the Mind behind?

@aman_ramnani The more you remain in the heart, the less the mind will affect you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What would you say to a young person, who understands that financial freedom is a prerequisite for seeking the Truth, who fears that his DNA may become corrupt by 'soul-crushing' jobs?

Basically put, how to make money while remaining sincere?

@ItsMeRuairi By understanding that the money serves a purpose

And if the purpose it serves is to allow one the luxury to devote himself to finding Freedom

What better use is there than this?

---

Within the four walls of his home

He tries to be happy.

At social events

He projects to be happy.

In business meetings

He pretends to be happy.

With subordinates

He tries to make them happy.

And for the whole of his life

He Never asks himself

Does Happiness Truly Exist?

# A Social Gathering of Truth

If humans insist upon having a social gathering

Then why not leave your jewelry at home

Change from a backless dress into a button-down shirt

Spend five seconds in front of a mirror instead of two hours in the makeup studio

Invite the real humans instead of the fake ones

Become real yourself, instead of hiding behind a mask

And honestly and openly discuss the pains of your lives

Rather than insult each other with false smiles and empty laughter?

This is a social gathering worth attending.

Before giving advice to another

Ask yourself if YOU have done it.

If you have not done it, 

Ask yourself WHY you have not done it.

And if you are Sincere,

You will discover that it is not "doable" by either of you

Because Prescriptions are Lies.

---

"Any attempt to force the mind against its habitual patterns is to incite it.

This is a war that no human has ever won.

What will transform you will not be a prescription, but a Space.

A space between the action, and the motivation behind this action"

---

When one arrives at a specific threshold of The Truth He no longer experiences Boredom. At another specific threshold He no longer experiences Sorrow.

---

In every problem, situation, or circumstance, there's always a truth. It is the source of a decision which categorizes it as Truth or not. This is Kapil's mode of attack in all things.

---

- "The only reason you don't have what you want, is because you didn't really want it." 
  - "The only reason you have the things you do, is because you couldn't live without them"
  - "The only reason you are where you are, is because somewhere in you, it's okay for you to be there"

---

All human beings seek engagement, to be lost in whatever they do - that is the central human desire

My sincerity and desire to live a sweet spot of a life, is to the absolute point of desperation. I do not want a single moment of a day to go by, that I do not truly feel immersed

---

The Secret is not to Win

But to win without having to compete.

---

When a human sees a magic trick, he is enthralled and excited.

When the trick is uncovered, the excitement fades.

Excitement and emotion arise when something is not understood.

As it is understood, one naturally becomes unfazed.

One naturally becomes equanimous.

He does not become equanimous because it is good to be equanimous.

He becomes equanimous because he sees the whole of the thing, without any gaps in his understanding.

The wise man is naturally quiet, subdued, and largely silent.

---

The real danger of arriving at The Truth

Is the indescribable pain for having so carelessly wasted all the prior years of his life.

---

A person does not react to the Insult

He reacts to what the insult makes him feel about himself.

---

Freedom is living without attachment.

Because attachment is the most binding, destructive, painful, and imprisoning thing in all of human existence.

If the Buddhists agree with this, then they are correct.

But then they try to get rid of attachment through meditation. And this where the temple roof caves in.

I will look every Buddhist in the face throughout the world, from the highest ranked to the lowest one and say this:

You can meditate until Buddha's reincarnation. You can meditate until the sun burns out. You can meditate until the earth grows tired of spinning on its axis. Meditation will never conquer attachment. Never!

---

@hjmontene Happiness and misery are two sides of the same coin

It is not possible to have one without the other.

---

@KapilGuptaMD "Never give up" they say. But what to do when efforts bring no results for a long period of time? Where's the line between fighting on and accepting that a goal can't be achieved?

@SznajderMichal_ You must arrive at the understanding that you are seeking the Fruits of your labors

Rather than the inner workings of The Game

Thus your pursuit is impure

And unfruitful.

@KapilGuptaMD I am not sure I understand what "inner workings of The Game" means... and therefore how to make the efforts pure. Thank you.

@SznajderMichal_ Discover what remains in your pursuit of craft

After you remove success, money, and rewards.

@KapilGuptaMD You say man is fond of struggle. Why?

@Bgh80782447 He does not know who he would be without it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I find myself deciding between things I feel I should do (often prescriptions) and things that are instantly gratifying. I am deciding between vegetables and desert in each moment. There is so much rigidity here - how can I find freedom from and the truth behind this pattern?

@seguthart By finding freedom from "should's and should not's"

---

The heights that a man reaches

Is a function of what he Fears Most.

For fears direct his step and his stride.

---

The Truest and most Effective response to anything your Mind says to you

Is not a single word

Nor a single thought.

---

Humans care less about what products Do for them

Than what the products Say about them.

---

The day that a man becomes unmoved by Pleasure

The Mind will run out of its fuel for Chatter.

---

Doing, hoping, practicing, ritualizing, and routine-ing are all an Empty Chase.

Such things are Followed because humans are more interested in "practicing" than they are in Arriving.

One Arrives not when he becomes Proficient at the "practices"

But when he grows Tired of them.

---

Impatience trumps patience

Sincerity trumps practice

Innocence trumps intelligence

Understanding trumps intellect

Purity trumps hard work

Solitude trumps socialization

Becoming trumps instructing

Seeing trumps doing

Truth trumps prescriptions.

The present can not be walked towards, it has to be backed into"

---

If someone calls one stupid, and that person gets angry, you have to examine why that person became angry - why did the anger arise?
    - If someone called you a cloud, would you get angry?
    - The reason the anger arose - when that person was called stupid, he or she for a moment, entertained the possibility that they were in fact stupid
      - When that possibility was entertained, the ego did not like the fact that part of them entertained the idea that they were stupid - this produces internal conflict which outwardly manifests itself as anger -THE TRUTH

---

The things that the mind tells me are correct, are almost never correct

---

If one examines his life, he discovers that he is in a constant state of Chasing and Fixing.

So ubiquitous is this experience in his life and in the lives of those around him that he never thinks to question this.

He has never realistically entertained a Life Free Of Problems.

---

But let us proceed in such a way as to Experience the Truth as we learn it. The mind is a clever beast, my King. Upon seeing what it is that we are trying to do, it will sabotage our efforts. And it will do so in the cleverest of ways. The cleverest of which is through Intellectualization.

---

A life of Preferences

Is a very difficult life.

---

"Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego. Ego is a habit of the self

And the self does not, in truth, exist

Thus, nothing in a man’s life is truly real

For reality is the nameless, identity-less, mind-less, and thought-less Void"

---

After one dies,

The happiness game ends

The money game ends

The relationship game ends

The success game ends

The self-improvement game ends

The parenting game ends

The status game ends

The fear of death game ends.

Everything in this life,

Is but a fleeting game.

---

The state of one’s Mind

Is the state of one’s Life.

@KapilGuptaMD I wish to remove discomfort from my life, but understand this will lead to more extreme suffering. 

I wish to change this, but do not know how. 

I long for contentment, but that desire is not stronger than my need for comfort. 

How do I align my goals and my actions?

@Burly86068590 The last line of your message does disservice to the Wisdom of the previous Three.

Those three lines are The Truth.

It would be wise not to leave them.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What environment would lead to being a person expressing “life” and not being enslaved by the mind?
@Giovanni5_55 An environment which propelled one to seek The Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I don’t know who I am. The more I look the more I run into societal conditioning. Is this a state of truth?
@dlabo10 Yes.

---

When one is no longer attached to needing respect, love, or reciprocation, or for someone else to make him happy when one is no longer attached to the idea of happiness itself he becomes wildly free

---

Man's neuronal machinery conjoins man's experiences

This is known as Consciousness.

(And it is completely illusory).

Consciousness is the dream

It is Not the dreamer.

---

If there is a realization worthy of devoting a human life

If there is a realization that provides true freedom and permanent and sustained satisfaction

If there is an enlightenment of enlightenments

It is the practical realization that you Truly and Genuinely 

Do not exist.

---

In all domains

Truth and Popularity are mutually exclusive.

---

In order to understand this, one must understand that the journey of almost all men is not a Journey toward Truth. It is a Journey of aversions

---

Chases.

==Perfect Knowledge lies in the Question that no one has thought to ask.==

And so long as a man is enslaved to his need for validation, he will be limited to finding answers to the ones being asked.

Perfect Knowledge lies in the pure desire To Know.

Rather than in the desire to be seen as the one who knows

---

Life becomes effortlessly livable

When one no longer needs anything from it.

---

The wise man asks himself,

“How much are my opinions costing me?”

---

Man is a Universe Of One.

He is the striker and the stricken

The sinner and the forgiver

The winner and the congratulator

The needer and the giver

The melancholic and the consoler.

Man’s existence is a self-tight compartment

“Others” are but a grand illusion.

---

Man wants what he does not have

And ignores that which he has.

For man does not so much desire his wants

As much as he abhors being denied of them.

---

Humans are told to ask, How can I do the maximum?

They are enslaved to the false god of hard work

They are shackled to the myth of "doing more" than another.

The True Question is,

What is the maximum I can eliminate, so that I may focus my efforts upon the essential minimum?

---

To Arrive At Peace:

One must by organic and non-prescriptive means arrive at the understanding 

That neither life or its people

Can create for him a life of lasting satisfaction.

For lasting satisfaction can only be had

When one needs Not A Thing

From life, or its people.

---

Conflicts are not the result of behaviors observed

But of intentions perceived.

@jimmpierce Why he wishes to rid himself of it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the difference between love and attachment?
@BigSurdy88 "Love" is an opaque word

Attachment is clear.

Attachment is Need.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What do you make of goals and planning?
@the_0versoul They tend to be done for ulterior motives

Rather than for purposes of Purity.

Thus, they have little significance

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is truth understood without any description of the understanding?
@Dead_Dream_Live Because it is Visceral

Rather than intellectual.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is there anything that we don't do with selfishness?
@ChouchaniEsther Not really.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What do you think about comedy, is professional comedy an art to you? There is the adage "laughter is the best medicine" and it's seen positively but is it anything more than a pleasurable experience?
@maydaytrade Anything can be an Art.

It is in the quality, rather than the topic or the medium.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, what understanding leads towards Dispassion ?
@ZobairSiddique The understanding that there is Nothing.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What must a man realize to arrive at permanent satisfaction? That will bring an end to his constant chase for pleasure
@NethersTheorem That all things in this life are an empty chase

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why comes first, thought or emotion. To put it more clearly, do thoughts generated emotion, or does the underrunning emotion generate thoughts

@Cloudwater00 Thoughts generate emotion

---

Wisdom

Or lasting satisfaction

Or transformation

Cannot be found in practices or methodologies.

Such things arise within the human who longs directly for Them.

They do not arise in the human who longs to play the role of one who seeks them.

---

To like and dislike is a habit of the Mind

It binds man to the purgatory of craving and aversion.

If one trains the mind to have no likes or dislikes

He becomes equanimous.

This equanimity affords him the clarity to witness

The Nature of Things.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How can one become more aware of his surroundings, and really pay attention to little details instead of filtering them out?

@ManasSarpatwar A human becomes aware of things that are of value to him

You are asking how to be more aware of things that have little value to you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD At what age did you know you would choose the path of truth?

@SynphZ I do not know

It is not important.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How not to be scared of being in the present moment everytime?

@hjmontene There is no such thing as "how not to be scared"

If you are afraid, discover the source of the fear

Instead of looking for a "fix."

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one get beyond the intellectual and moral arguments of the mind and see the truth? Is everything of consequence in life, a matter of desire or lack there of?

@KarthikMallavar Yes.
All things are related to desire.

@KapilGuptaMD Being so far off of the truth and the journey, its hard for me to tie something to desire because a lot of things I do are not things I desire or despise. I think a lot of it is conditioning and I do because I’ve always done. How to break that cycle?

@KarthikMallavar By realizing Viscerally
What you have just stated Intellectually.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why the importance of dispassion and how does one cultivate it?

@fanfanfufu Dispassion is the ultimate state of being
For one arrives at it when he has eliminated all the lies that he has become conditioned to believing.

---

@KapilGuptaMD what do you think is the most valuable thing to learn?

@drag0n_unm4skd That the self does not exist.

---

@KapilGuptaMD As you get closer to Truth, do you get closer to No Self?

@jasonfiore It depends upon the Truth you are seeking.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Self knowledge is in reality mind knowledge?

@emsagahon Relatively, yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Do you define truth as that which cannot be reduced any further?

@JonathanNox1 Often, yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD If self doesn't exist, why do we all have unique preferences, thought processes, talents?

@i_Wein The idea of a self exists
Thus, the preferences and so forth.

@KapilGuptaMD Can you expand a little further on the idea?

@i_Wein Mind creates self

Mind is the one who has all the preferences

Talent does not belong to Self

It comes through the individual

Not From the individual

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have realized that my attempt to end my chasing of pleasure is a chase for pleasure. What breaks the cycle?

@NethersTheorem You are refusing to see the harm that comes from chasing pleasure.

Period.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sometimes everything looks pointless (not out of frustration, but due to impermanence). Other times there is frustration of “when questions will end, and focus will converge to 1 thing?”. And the mind swings between two states and generates pathetic mediocrity. Prescription?

@Gobigorgodown Are you truly asking me for a prescription?

@Gobigorgodown You were moving along so nicely.

There was Sincerity in your words.

Then you removed a knife from your back pocket and, with your final word, mercilessly destroyed a perfectly insightful question.

Shame.

@KapilGuptaMD With sincerity.🙏🏼. I am tired of doing pointless things. I tried everything within capacity, nothing feels like a true purpose. With that divergent energy, the “want of pleasure from actions” keep clouding the sight. I truly feel tired (not weak). I can’t keep trying forever.

@Gobigorgodown Trying and Effort lead nowhere.

Invest yourself in this understanding Here, Now, Tonight. 

Devote the rest of your evening to this one understanding.

Do not leave it

Do not tell me you "understand"

Devote yourself to understanding this one thing

@Gobigorgodown Your words are Sincere

It was a worthwhile use of my time responding to you.

@KapilGuptaMD  Namaste.

x

.@Gobigorgodown through his/her question demonstrates depth, longing, sincerity, desperation, and honesty

Not curiosity, intellect, cleverness, or humor

He/she destroyed his/her first question by the word "prescription"

But redeemed his/herself with Sincerity and Heart.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do I have involuntary thought? What prevents me from understanding it?

@jimmpierce Because you believe in a Self.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why, in your infinite wisdom, ask for questions when you know so many don't understand or even slightly know Truth? and know they WILL ask the trivial and insincere, unbenounced to themselves their doing. Then you go an make a statement about something you are aware an expecting?

@thetonymontoya I do so in order to bring THAT ONE along the final mile.

---

The wisest wish from a genie in a bottle would be:

To remove from a human

Every drop, trace, and shadow

Of Need.

Purity and Truth would naturally, and of their own accord,

Bloom in such a soil.

---

A man feels anxiety

If it does not matter to him that he is anxious, the anxiety is harmless.

For it not to matter that he is anxious, he must find a home other than the home that is free of anxiety

This home is the understanding that Mind is, and will always be, Anxiety.

@KapilGuptaMD This helped me understand that

It is not about overcoming ones desire for pleasure

It is about recognizing that chasing pleasure is a habit of the mind

And that as long as the mind is there, the habit to chase pleasure will be too

And recognizing that you are not the mind

---

The Truth does not lie in feeling guilty

The Truth does not lie in apologies

The Truth does not lie in blame another or oneself

The Truth does not lie in encouragement, praise, or gratitude

The Truth does not lie in altruism or sacrifice

The Truth lies in Learning The Truth.


---

If man's entire life is lost in a world of thought, then what in his life is truly real?

Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego. Ego is a habit of the self.

And the self does not, in truth, exist.

Therefore, there is nothing in a man's life that is truly real

---

Siddha Secret: Self-Image

If a man looks closely, he will discover

That, in his mind's eye, 

He views himself differently

With every man that he meets.

---

Thought creates the disease. Thought creates the fix.

Thus, the fix does not cure the disease.

The fix . . . is the disease itself.

---

If man's entire life is lost in a world of thought, then what in his life is truly real?

Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego. Ego is a habit of the self.

And the self does not, in truth, exist.

Therefore, there is nothing in a man's life that is truly real.

For reality is the nameless, identity-less, mind-less, and thought-less Void.

Therefore, man's entire life is a chain of lies that spans three quarters of a century

---

The only human being that can find True Peace is the one who is able to withstand the inconceivable and outrageous indifference that is life

---

Man is endowed with the power to control outcomes.

This is achieved by controlling one’s interiority.

The power to control outcomes is lost if used to acquire pleasurable experiences

The power to control interiority is lost if prescriptions are employed.

---

“I do not know”

Is a sanctuary.

---

Pleasure

1) The Mind exists purely for pleasure
2) Food, socialization, entertainment, exercise, meditation, travel, spending, even chores
4) Every microsecond is a search for pleasure
5) In his entire life, a man will not do One Thing that does not in some way give him pleasure

---

Rain can only soak one who is dry

Pain can only hurt one who craves pleasure

Turmoil can only affect one who craves peace

Conflict can only harm one who craves harmony

Mud can only soil one who is clean.

The one who craves Nothing

Can be harmed by Nothing.

---

Man spends his entire life searching for the “right” way to be.

As promising as these “ways” seem

They all prove to be empty chases.

One must learn for himself that being  a Nobody 

Who is permanently embedded in the cocoon of a single moment

Is the end of all chases.

---

Why don't people search for the truth? 

  - Because the only loudspeaker they hear is the voice of society
    - The voice that says - "Be present", "Meditate", "Go to conferences"
      - "There is enough there to last a human being 50 lifetimes. When is he going to have the time to exhaust everything and find out none of them work?"
  - For your own transformation - All you need to know is that the voice of society has led you absolutely nowhere
  - "Knowing where 'it' isn't is far more instructive, practical, immediate, acute and powerful than knowing where 'it' is"

---

The Transformation that follows hearing The Truth

Is not so dependent upon the content of the particular Truth

As upon the Ripeness of the one who hears it.

---

Why don't human beings see the obvious?

  - A lack of interest
  - "Human beings are very preoccupied individuals, they're caught in the momentum of everyday existence."
    - Everyone is caught up in putting out the fires of daily life
      - The fires in a relationship, the fires at work, the fires of what pleasure to satisfy next, the fire of why this person doesn't like me anymore

---

The truth is not a movement towards pleasure, the truth is a movement towards the absence of the need for pleasure"
    - All pleasure fades
    - Reality on the other hand never leaves you

---

"Losing your mind is precisely the path to sanity"
  - "Man is fundamentally a schizophrenic, and losing his mind is precisely the way out"
    - We hear thoughts all day long
    - We read into things that no one says
    - We see things that aren't there
    - We believe we're someone we're not

---

"Validation is the road to hell"
    - "The need for validation stops when you are satisfied by the purity behind the words that you speak, when that satisfaction is enough and does not need to be supported by any extra validation from anyone else"

# East and West 
  
Those from the East have traded the ancient wisdom of their civilizations  
  
For the “modernity and advancements” of the West.

One of the principle reasons for this is that the spiritualists of the East have dumbed down glorious ancient truths into a wastebasket of religious rituals and idol worship  
  
This has created a nation whose worship is motivated by a Fear of godly reprimand

Those in the West who make pilgrimages to the East are often more Sincere in their desire to learn about ancient wisdom, than the Easterners themselves  
  
But they tend to be too blinded by the pomp and ceremony of Eastern Spirituality to be ready for The Truth.

They return to the West, with notebooks under their arm  
  
And run incense-filled “meditation retreats”  
  
In which they they dump the prescriptionized contents of their notebooks upon the eager members of an audience that seeks “self-improvement”

In the end, neither the “guru-certified instructors” nor the disingenuous attendees get anywhere  
  
They hang on for dear life to the rationalization that although they may never have gotten anywhere, “at least they practiced and tried”

The replacement of ritual, religion, and spiritual traditions in the East  
  
With a Pure Pursuit of knowledge about the mind, and the Truth about life, as established by the ancient sages  
  
Can lead to the transformation of millions.  
  
This is humanity at its best.  
  
Namaste.

Man is concerned that others are not interested in his feelings.

However, all the problems in his life arise from his pathological concern about his own feelings.

---

Nether the devil

Nor the people of the world

Nor the wrath of nature itself . . .

Can lay a finger upon the man,

Who needs nothing from anyone.

Not even himself.

What imprisons a man most

Is not the reliability of the "bad"

But the possibility of the "good."

If I cannot have it Forever

I do not want it for a single Moment.

None of society’s tenets are Truths**.

**What is the proof for this?**

**The proof is that these tenets cannot stand alone.**

**Each tenet requires its counterpart.**

**A fix cannot survive without the problem it is trying to mend.**

**If the problem dies, the fix dies as well.**

**That which cannot stand on its own two feet, unreliant upon any element or authority, is Untruth.**

**Truth needs no support**.

---

A Master is always the same

Without trying to be.

For he has seen The Truth behind all things

And thus, does not succumb to the chase for happiness or pleasure.

---

M: **That when a man understands that he is nothing, he no longer has any need to enforce his will upon anyone or anything. He becomes like a willow. The world and its people can bend him, but he will never break.**

S: How is it that you arrived at such a state, Master. How did you become a willow?

M: Such unfathomable things do not happen by choice, student. One arrives at them when it is an inevitability.

S: It became inevitable for you, Master?

M: Yes.

S: In what way?

M: **I learned that everything in life turned out to be a dead end. Even the most promising of things. There was destitution at every turn. Things certainly went up, but when they came down they crashed into one million pieces. All “bad’s” were far more bad than the “good’s” were good. This led to seeing through the idea of good and bad

x

You will not have to make yourself. Life will make you. If you have the wisdom to see and to hear.**

**When you see that the good’s are not so good. And the bad’s are not so bad. You will lose interest in both. The day that you lose interest, you will have arrived at The Truth. From that day forward, you may bend in all glorious directions. But never will you break

---

It is wise to incessantly examine and observe in search of The Truth.

But any firm "conclusion" that one makes from his observations

Will be incomplete and premature.

---

He who harbors no demands

Attracts no problems.

No one in your life will understand you

The ones who say they do are doing their best to “compassionately pretend.”

@KapilGuptaMD When so many things in life is determined by your place of birth and events happening in life, how much free will an individual has!??

@swetshah The question is not one of free will

For the depth of a given desire trumps any and all circumstances.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I had an insight the other day, in which I saw the lack of a self with perfect clarity. Now I no longer have that clarity—I only remember it. For this realization to become permanent, must I arrive at it repeatedly?

@jimmpierce The only things that remain Permanent

Are those that are side effects of Realization.

The things that are fleeting

Are those that are sought after in the form of "an experience."

---

@KapilGuptaMD why a human keep repeating what doesn't work even though his daily life depend on memory ? 

why he forgets that the thing didnt work out last time he tried it in that way ?
when does one sees that budhi is stronger ?

@rohantw Human beings do not function by way of logic.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In what ways does right questions create a path?.. What quality  one needs to  sense the path being created?

@muthunagarajan1 The perfect Question stirs investigation

"Answers" lead to a prescription chase.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to observe thoughts?

@ajiteshc27 There is no point.

---

@KapilGuptaMD With all sincerity, do friends have any role in your life?

@cyborean My life is devoted to seeking Truth

A rather unpopular and anti-social pursuit.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What does it take to reach max possible happiness level?

@KushalTweets991 Max possible suffering

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you live your life knowing that it will come to an end one day?

@i_Wein It is only Then that one is able to truly Live.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I struggle with approval seeking. What is the truth behind this flaw outside of seeing the world through an attachment to the self?

@ndsa1208 The only flaw
Is attempting to be rid of it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is memory?

@TheTemp10 A burden.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What question do you wish you were asked more often?

@russshanahan There are few individuals that seem to consistently ask quality questions

Their questions demonstrate a significant degree of self-examination

They do not ask flippantly or curiously or intellectually

It reflects a unique inner DNA.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is the conquering of the mind similar to conquering an opponent on the battlefield. Or is it a never ending battle where the mind constantly resurfaces?

@Sharan_Piave It is not a fight

It is a quiet understanding.

---

@KapilGuptaMD what must one see to stop identifying with thought?

@minecraftscum That virtually all thoughts are lies.

---

M: **There is no right or wrong, student. There is only cause and effect**.

S: Might you expand a little, Master?

M: **There is nothing wrong with victories, rewards, or ambitions. The question is what effect they have upon a human being.**

S: And what effect is that?

M: **Where there is a reward on the horizon, there will be an effect upon the human mind. The effect will result in a chase.**

S: If I may ask, what is wrong with a chase?

M: **It would be more effective to ask what the Effect of a chase is.**

S: And what is that?

M: **The effect of a chase is anxiety. A man who chases will live under the weight of hope, fear, and anxiety. Any thought or action that arises from hope, fear, or anxiety is a reactive thought or action. Any thought or action that is reactive is not Truth. Thus it is bound to create more problems in its wake.**

This is a path that can never lead to permanence, peace, mastery, or one's true potential. This is a path that cannot lead to an Arrival.

There is nothing wrong or improper about playing the silly little games you play with yourself

There is nothing bad about living a lie

The problems begin

A prayer for the Ignorant:

Dear god, please bless me. And give me this and that.

A prayer for the Wise:

Dear Universe, allow me to see with crystal clarity how Hope sets me up for an inevitable fall.

And allow me to see the monumental cost of living a life of Need.

---


The problem with Reward

Is that it feels good.

The problem with feeling good

Is that it is pleasurable.

The problem with pleasure

Is that man enjoys it beyond compare.

Thus, such a one is chained to hankering for a reward

And, therefore, he is doomed to a life of anxiety.

---

It is 100 times easier to accept that one is “doing it wrong”

Than it is to believe that the concept is a lie.

The spiritual and performance community knows this

It is their ace in the hole.

---

Information is imperfect to entirely false

If it arises from the impurity of personal motive.

Scientific papers are motivated by “publish or perish”

Magazines are motivated by sensationalism and sales

Truth has little market value

But massive value for the one who learns it.

---

What is the Meaning Of Life?

Life is not a puzzle to be solved

It is an essence to be Accessed.

It is accessible by the One

Who arrives at the realization

That the person who is asking this question

Does not, in truth, exist.

---

All anger directed at oneself

Is mock outrage.

---

Among the most sincere and effective actions

Is to put on a clean white shirt and pressed pants,

Draw the curtains and turn off the phone,

Sit on the floor in the corner of a dark and quiet room,

And ask oneself,

“What is it that I Really Want?”

---

The selfish recluse obsessed with achieving self realization

Benefits the world infinitely more

Than the “selfless” philanthropist obsessed with charitable deeds.

Among the greatest of all Superpowers

Is the immunity to Pleasure.

A Herculean Power

A Transformative human milestone:

Arriving at the place

In which one no longer has to answer to their Mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why attachments are so attractive and interesting, apart from destructive ?

@ZobairSiddique Because they provide the opportunity for pleasure.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you find balance financially and spirituality? Meaning that most need to work to survive and being present at work is often difficult.

@VernonHeater Spirituality is a dead-end

Balance is a dead-end

Trying to be present is a dead-end

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is focusing on solving multiple problems at a time effective? Also, where would the paralysis from feeling overwhelmed come from?

@theodore_nit Problems are not cured by being "solved"

They are cured by being Seen.

---

@KapilGuptaMD When my utmost desires are about to be fulfilled, i suddenly quit ... to regret later. Why ?

@ZobairSiddique You did not really want them.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Do words weaken the truth?

@Feezy_F Yes.

But a boat is needed to cross the river, before it can be abandoned.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have battled with anxiety for a while now, and everything I've tried has been a series of temporary fixes. What do you suggest I do to end this suffering?

@AbstractOnion Explore the nature of the suffering

Without any attempt to end it.

@KapilGuptaMD To what end, then?

@AbstractOnion Transformation lies in the Seeing

Not in the fixing.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I want to just be, but my mind wanders. How can I train my mind to be still?

@not_Mehdi By understanding that wanting to "just be" is yet another form of Unstillness.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why we all running? and the destination really exists?

@imragupathi The Mind is a desiring machine.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Do the fantasies that my mind constantly revisits have any resemblance to what I truly desire?

@NethersTheorem You do not truly desire anything.

@KapilGuptaMD Am I mistaken in thinking that the impetus that drives an athlete/artist/CEO is a deep-seated desire or vision?

@NethersTheorem It is always a desire

It may or may not be a vision.

@KapilGuptaMD What makes you say I do not truly desire anything?

@NethersTheorem It is the Mind that desires.

@KapilGuptaMD Does acting on the desire of the mind come at a cost? Is it just another empty chase?

@NethersTheorem Yes.

But this will not have the power to stop you from doing it.

@KapilGuptaMD Then what is the impetus of pure, innocent engagement in a craft? 

That is what I miss about being a kid. Zero consideration of other people’s opinions, zero anxiety about outcomes.

@NethersTheorem Too much want and chase

A total refusal to see where you Are.

@KapilGuptaMD Thank you for answering my questions.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the difference between Feeling and The Truth? I’m reading one of your books now and it seems you feel feeling = truth. But I assume it’s not a direct 1:1, would love your thoughts

@GrantDuckworth Feeling is closer to Truth than thought

But it is not Truth itself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How did you learn to ask great questions to yourself to gain understand of what you want to know the truth about? I feel like I need to ask myself better questions, but I don’t necessarily know how to come to those questions.

@arnej247365 A burgeoning disinterest in the status quo

A burgeoning desire to truly Know.

@KapilGuptaMD In a podcast you said one of your favorite questions is “what is right in front of me that I am just not seeing.” What is another question you ask yourself a lot?

@arnej247365 This Question is one that is enough to last a lifetime.

@KapilGuptaMD I love that question. Ever since I heard you say that I use it all the time. Thank you.

@arnej247365 Be careful about "using it."

@KapilGuptaMD Yeah it doesn’t work all the time. It’s not a fail safe, I don’t know what it is, must be intuition and sincerity, but there is something about that question that is different.

---

If a man discovers Truth

In any form

In any domain,

He must realize that any discussions about it

Will only serve to separate him from it.

The world will not understand.

The man of Truth must walk alone.

---

Learn from the stillness of Trees

Learn from the grace of the gliding Cloud

Learn from the freedom of the flowing Stream

Learn from the naturalness of a bird in flight.

Nature has settled into an Arrival.

He who abandons all his chases

Does precisely the same.

---

The things that we understand, create Silence

The things that we do not, create Emotion.

---

A gentleman I just met passionately urged me to help the world and improve generations

It is natural to believe that if humans are “helped,” they transform.

The Truth is, rare is the human who seeks to be separated from the comfort and familiarity of his illusions.

---

No human in the history of the world

Has ever failed because they did not have the necessary “know-how”

Or because they lacked sufficient luck or opportunity.

They failed because they did not have the Requisite Desire.

---

The end of Involuntary Thought

Is Everything.

It is the Truth that summarizes all Truths.

But rare is the man who is ready for the fantastical thoughts and dreams of his life

To come to an end.

For this would create

And end to his own existence.

---

Wherever a man sees a train of Pleasure,

He buys a ticket and hops aboard.

These trains have numerous convenient pick-up locations

But they all go to the same destination:

The edge of a cliff.

---

It is a transformative milestone in a human being’s life

When he no longer looks forward to anything

Nor succumbs to despair.

When the things that once excited or disappointed him

Have lost their power over him.

When bright colors

Fade into pale pastels.

---

The Master observes.

Not for practice or austerity

Nor for improvement or “spirituality.”

He observes in order to see with total clarity,

The futility of it all.

---

What is a human being’s greatest burden?

A desire for that which he currently does not possess

And cannot guarantee to possess in the near future.

---

The man who, by any possible means, arrives at a place of:

“I am unconcerned with the way that I feel. Be it high or low, pleasant or unpleasant. For I have learned that such feelings are whims of a wayward mind, beyond my control”

Is a man who can never be touched by anxiety.

---

What is a human being’s greatest fear?

Feeling in a way he does not wish to feel.

---

The Vision must be created with delicate and painstaking precision

It is only then that one is in a position to ruthlessly eliminate anything and everything that does not move one toward it.

---

"When the good’s no longer shine bright

And the bad’s no longer create concern

Something fundamental changes within a man

He becomes Available to Truth.

He now possesses the time and space to see what he has never before seen"

- The Purity Of Action

(A Private Discourse)

---

It is never about “working”

It is all about The Work.

The glory lies in the Creation

The bliss lies in the Engagement.

For after all the riches have been amassed

And the applause has faded into oblivion

The Purity of the creation

Is all a man truly has.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Does one need to eliminate the ego or learn from it.

@JinKwon Neither.

@KapilGuptaMD how to do work while staying in a state of detachment?

@Anejagaurav Detachment cannot be an ideal to live up to

Ideals go nowhere.

@KapilGuptaMD Is there any work that is true, or leads me to the truth?

@moyinho20 The work that you cannot live without.

@KapilGuptaMD Is ignorance bliss for human?

@sanoc720 Ignorance is expensive.

@KapilGuptaMD Why is it that I am tortured by a need to feel validated by my parents. What is it that I have not seen?

@CanteneW They will be serious about you

When you are serious about yourself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Last time I asked a question about desire/vision and you told me that “you do not truly desire anything,” that it is the mind that desires.

What then is the utility in asking oneself, “What do I truly desire?” Or in creating a precise vision regarding what one wants to achieve?

@NethersTheorem Man desires losing himself

Find the thing which you can lose yourself in.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, why do i become lenient to people whose chains are tied to my feet? And not become insolent enough to break them to find other ways of freedom ?

@ZobairSiddique There is something you gain from doing so.

---

@KapilGuptaMD A part of me relys on the love of others, yet the love is always hollow, how do i move into a way that is greater than attatchment to love?

@werdnawod Experience and observe the consequences of attachment.

@KapilGuptaMD How does one achieve true peacefulness?

@gabeojeda Liberation from the self.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What makes one pursue truth?

@ananthrk It is unique to a given person.

@KapilGuptaMD If an opinion is a personal belief then why do we get offended when we hear others opinions on a subject?

@11ho_oh11 It changes your opinion about yourself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How can I stay longer in the place between what I see and What I feel?

@ImmortalMortal0 If you truly See

You care not how you feel.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one differentiate between "instinct" and "mind"? 

Thank you

@ndsa1208 It is all mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you discover what you need to be focus on?

Being one that has a varying interest.

@real_DavidALADE There are interests

And there are obsessions.

---

If a man exposes his Mind solely to the things he wants it to imbibe,

If he engineers his every action in order to allow his Mind to record only the things he wants it to play back to him,

He will have created his interior Environment precisely to his specifications.

---

A Question for he who seeks a Life Of Satisfaction:

What is that Truth

That upon having seen it,

The desiring machine that is the Mind

Will come to an immediate halt.

---

Few men come to realize

That their entire life

Has been lived inside their Mind.

---

Every fortuitous event

Comes with a catch.

Every promise

Contains an asterix.

The wise man comes to see that there is nothing to look forward to in this life.

What lies immediately before him

Is the only thing he can trust

And the only thing there is.

---

It is nether wrong nor right to tend to the needs of the body

It is, however, worthy to consider that this body that commands a man’s attention and devotion for his entire life

Is, even for the eternal optimist,

Headed toward a permanent grave.

---

A man’s ultimate Freedom

Lies in a total indifference

To the way he is treated.

---

"The reason that one makes an effort is in order to chase or to flee.

And because chasing and fleeing are reactive actions, they are not Truth

They harbor an ulterior motive

Thus, they are doomed to fail."

- The Myth Of Effort

---

Humans tend to be at their worst in the home environment

For that is where they are the most Attached.

---

The greatest preparation for life

Is to eliminate meaning and significance from all things.

---

A Pure Journey

To the pinnacle of the greatest mountain

Can only be made Alone.

For in the company of one’s peers,

A man suffers the distractions of comparison and competition

And, in so doing,

Wastes precious years

Precious talents

And precious possibilities.

---

The man who is desperate to arrive at The Truth

With a blatant disregard for his opinions,

Lives a uniquely extraordinary life

And becomes privy to what few men ever come to know.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is through logic how we arrive to the truth?

@Marcos80390591 Logic keeps one from The Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is a calculated risk under uncertain conditions? If one wants to be in sales or marketing, what is the merit of going into a field he knows like computer science if he is not a good salesperson or marketer?

@lioninawhat A risk that is calculated will not yield The Ultimate.

It is best to find that which you cannot help but to "risk" everything for.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is part of the mind subconscious? If so can it be conquered consciously?

@thunderbythesea Nothing can be conquered through effort, practice, and prescriptions

All can be conquered through Understanding.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why are we here? How can I find my purpose?

@Beef_010 There is no purpose.

Truth lies in discovering that the "you" that is here

Does not allow you to be Here.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What am I looking for when I'm feeling anxious and trying to escape from said anxiety ?

@ekastelano Pleasure.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I want to know what I really want in this life. At some thought I knew but slippled trough my fingers. I try to imagine my life but from some time it does not work anymore, I feel lost again and cannot imagine my life and chose a path. How can I find out? Thank you

@CryptoZ22962365 A life spent firmly entrenched in the cognizance of Not Knowing

Is not a wasted life.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Most of the times , I do not work to accomplish/succeed, I always work to fail safe. What is it that i am not seeing ?

@Assembledchaos That is your way of "succeeding"

---

@KapilGuptaMD What should be the primary aim/goal when whatever you do happens to fail eventually?

What should be the course correction method?

@SoulfulCircus Realizing viscerally

What you have just stated intellectually.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Your thoughts on the importance of persistence ? Thank you.

@Someshchandran As a prescription, it has no value.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the source of my and so many of your followers’ internal struggle — is it fighting against societal conditioning only? Or is the struggle / yearning built in to our DNA?

@chhhris All struggle arises from not having seen The Truth

Not having seen The Truth arises from being lost in a world of prescriptions.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What’s your definition of the Truth?

@aalamer84 Cannot define it

It is a road away from all prescriptions

And arriving at that which truly IS

And leaving behind that which exists only in the mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I fear for the future and this gives me waves of sadness and fustration. What I fear is very real though far away. I have trouble accepting it when I know it will happen at some point. Will I always suffer or will I attain peace before the event horizon? Thank you

@Glarmo Even if every hope in a man's life came true,

He will have suffered his life away hoping for it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is being “a natural” at some skill merely another illusion? Is there something that allows one to be a natural at everything?

@jimmpierce Innate Talent indeed exists

To Understand everything

Is the greatest talent.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I wish to understand the nature of urgency. Immediate problems seem to create the pressure to solve themselves, but what is the nature of the pressure that can change a man permanently?

@kutaisi5 There are many possibilities

One is the visceral understanding that he has no time left

That he is about To Die.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Nearly every time I have had what I term a momentary glimpse of reality I have found myself feeling incredibly moved, some sort of beautiful sadness that nevertheless feels really good, and often laughing hysterically at all of us. Is this a reliable indicator of anything?

@MutualArising The most important indicator

Is the pleasure you received from it

And the pleasure that keeps you seeking it.

The Truth is not a Chase.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have so many projects. And goals. And ideas. But been going round in circles for years. How do I choose where to focus?

@thenewc0l0mb0 It is perhaps best to focus upon the one which provides satisfaction even in times of failure.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it wise to not to tell our children about the suffering of this world until they are of age?

@RawasMohamed2 The only suffering a man cares about

And the only one that matters

Is his own.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is it effortless to lose oneself in the craft they love, yet find losing themselves in other things in life not that effortless? Is the desire to lose oneself a true desire or just another trick the mind plays to keep one chasing?

@DebneilM If used as a prescription, it is a trick

If one realizes that he is at his best in those times that he has lost himself

One begins to Understand.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Are all the questions asked by the mind?

@RamonVasquezM All except the truly Sincere ones.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it possible to regulate the thinking process through deliberate effort born out of strong conviction and understanding?

@iyerkum This is the concept of "mindfulness"

And fails every time.

---

@iyerkum This is the concept of "mindfulness"

And fails every time.

@danomarr Things begin to transform within a human

When all chases lose their luster.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sometimes you get motivation to do something worthwhile and "good" and you are boosted and next day you are still laying wasting your time. Does this mean one is not serious about his dreams?

@MundraShivansh That which is done through motivation is also a waste

For motivation fades.

That which is done to be "good" is also a waste

For good and bad are not Truth.

---

The Truth is a path away from all doctrines

All practices

All austerities

All rituals

All beliefs

All penances

All hope

All striving

All spiritualities

These are made to appease the masses.

The Truth is for the man who is desperate for IT

Rather than "the way" to IT.

---

Freedom

Lies in freedom from the notion

That there is something to attain.

---

"Only the one who has recognized the insignificance of a thing can pursue it in a manner that is serious

Only the one who has recognized the insignificance of a thing can pursue it in Freedom without turmoil."

---

The man who seeks to Arrive

By one manner or another, Arrives.

The man who does not truly seek to Arrive,

"Works hard."

---

Society has told you a romantic lie

You do not have to "work for it"

Or "pay your dues."

You simply have to know the Backdoor Path that takes you there.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In one of your discourses you said the secret to become world class is to do the thing for the thing itself not for the reward. For someone who wants wealth how can one know if his desire is genuine and not just wanting the pleasurable aspects of it?

@MatimbeMarco Your desire is not genuine

But if avoiding pleasure

Or being genuine

Becomes a rule to live up to

He will go nowhere.

---

@KapilGuptaMD For someone who is convinced of the Truth but has not discovered it, where should effort be focused on in his journey towards it?

@iyerkum If one is Serious

He will be interested in ridding himself of all in his life that is a lie

Beginning with his beliefs and opinions.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master 

What causes the side effect called Success?

What Understanding will arrive myself at the futility of Striving and Hardwork

---

@KapilGuptaMD Are we here for some purpose or just part of evolution as random creature?

@parthchawda56 There is no purpose

But if one finds Truth

Life becomes easily livable.

---

@KapilGuptaMD If my craft represents hard work, is not really my craft?

@emsagahon Only a deeply conditioned societal man would create a craft called "hard work"

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it possible for one in his pursue of sucess if he discover the truths about his industry not to become anxious or be attatched to the outcome?

@MatimbeMarco Any sentence that begins with "is it possible"

Makes it Impossible for the individual who is asking.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I am making limited progress at work.

I do not want to continue wasting my own time.

What question will give the me immediate clarity to drop all that I am doing to limit myself in my work?

@ArtplusCrypto What is keeping me from realizing Viscerally

What I have just stated Intellectually.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I want to have maximum with doing minimum.

Is is possible ?

Why one feels guilty to see it this way ?

@ZobairSiddique Conditioning.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is practicing not a requirement for excellence in performance?

@AdastraFinMx Human beings practice that which they already know how to do

And as a penance in hopes that they will be rewarded for their troubles.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the nature of feedback in the path to mastery?

@Assembledchaos Results.

@KapilGuptaMD Results depend on many factors, how should I interpret the result to improve specifics of the craft.

@Assembledchaos And where precisely one wishes to go

Did one get there

Or not?

That is the only result worth measuring.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is a practical sign to differentiate between hard work in the flow and hard work as a path to burn out? Thanks

@PlamenPetrov Hard work

In any of its cleverly used forms

Is a manifestation of Anxiety.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What understanding is required to not get attached to the one goal a person finds worthwhile dedicating everything to

@PhilMullerSA The consequences of attachment

Seen first hand.

---

@KapilGuptaMD @KapilGuptaMD what makes individuals collaborate with each other? 

Common goals/desire/values?


@BinMohammmed Insecurity

Conditioning

Fear of being alone.

---

@KapilGuptaMD We experience negative feelings like striving/hardwork when our intention is incorrect? 

So instead of looking for a reward or compensation, do the thing because you love to do it? Just a natural inclination?

Is this the path to “arrival”?

@rubenbryans Absolutely not

You are looking to follow rules

This you will meet with failure.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have felt the emptyness of domestic life. I see the futility of effort day in day out.

Yet, there is fear to start a new path. What am i waiting for?

@kap_flow Discover the nature of the fear.

---

The meditator is no different from the hedonist

The health nut is no different from the junk-food nut

Man is a pleasure-chaser

How ever he categorizes his chase.

He chases experiences

And calls it "progress."

He who loses his taste for pleasure

Is the one who truly Arrives

---

Self-blame is as futile as self-love

The latter is but a reaction to the former.

One's behavior is a natural consequence of his level of understanding, at any given moment in his life.

Realizing this, one moves away from the imprisoning concepts of good and evil.

---

A thing that is debated

Or institutionalized

Or celebrated

Or worshipped

Is seen only in name and form.

A Truth that is truly seen

Is seen quietly

Without excitement or celebration.

Like a leaf that quietly falls

In the dark of an ordinary night.

---

Quiet realizations

That are abandoned the moment they are heard,

Allow the seed to penetrate without the flash and pomp of the rind.

And are prevented from ballooning into significance

Within the theater of the Mind.

---

There is nothing quite so satisfying

As allowing one's eyes to see only Wisdom

And allowing one's ears to hear only Wisdom

For the Mind becomes saturated in the waters in which it is continually immersed

One becomes that which he continually sees, hears, and speaks.

---

Accept not

Deny not

And yours will be a life untroubled

---

The pitfalls of life are strategically placed

In order to trap the man who proudly pretends to know what he is doing.

---

Tomorrow, next month, or next year

May move in your favor, or against.

But one thing is for certain:

You will wreck yourself hoping for it.

---

Truth is far less accessible to the spiritual and the religious

Than to the heathen and the atheist.

---

There is nothing quite so satisfying

As allowing one's eyes to see only Wisdom

And allowing one's ears to hear only Wisdom

For the Mind becomes saturated in the waters in which it is continually immersed

One becomes that which he continually sees, hears, and speaks.

---

There is not a single pursuit in a man's life

That is not a procrastination.

---

Isolation from the world

Is a natural effect

Of those in whom Understanding begins to dawn.

---

"The Present Moment" is discovered

By the one who has seen with his very own eyes

The Cliff . . . at the end of every "path."

---

The man who asks "How," is the one who does not care to know.

The man who seeks "debate and discussion" is the one who seeks to show what he knows.

---

Man cannot bring himself to objectively examine what truly it is that he does in any 24-hour period

For this is the sort of shame that is best left unknown.

---

Objectively examining one's life

The serious man comes to the conclusion that each and every thought he has 

Is about "himself"

Of things and people that are "his"

Of things "he" would like to have

And ways he would like to "feel."

There is Nothing other than this.

---

If a man were held hostage for a year

Not allowed to think about "himself"

Not allowed to think about "others"

Not allowed to seek pleasure

And not allowed to seek "self-improvement"

What would he think?

What would he do?

(A question for yourself. Not seeking responses).

---

Whether or not your child speaks to you or respects you, or if you are adored or ridiculed by the world matters not. 

For even if all was just as you liked it, you would feel temporary pleasure, followed by permanent dissatisfaction.

Thus, Nothing matters

And All is for naught

---

Perhaps a life of Anonymity

Ruthlessly preserved

Is the truest and most effective life of all.

"Man must come to the understanding that there is no pursuit, achievement, or activity in existence that will satiate the human heart

And that there is no amount of book knowledge in the world that will satisfy his thirst."

---

@KapilGuptaMD what is the biggest problem of man?

@tj_dozier7 Belief in a Self.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Forgive me, I feel bad to ask, but is socialization a necessity for healthy mental life?

@ndsa1208 If one is burdened by the fear of loneliness, he has little choice but to socialize

Forcing anything upon oneself brings problems.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What does it look like for one to have arrived?

@Nothin2Much He understands all

Without frameworks, "mental models," or intellectualization

---

@KapilGuptaMD is to be mindless-ness to lose the mind narrator? when this occurs there still is an underlying self to act from?

@satts5 The mind-less man is a prisoner who has been set free

He acts by purity

Rather than by compulsive reaction to a self-centered desire.

---

@KapilGuptaMD The fundamental reason why I am drawn towards what you say, is it any different from what brings people to religion & spiritual gurus?

@notetwomyself For each person it is different

Most go for blessings and prescriptions.

Since there are none of those here

You will have to decide for yourself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How can you influence others who don’t want your practical advice?

@think__thank By recognizing that the problem is yours

The "ego of the helper"

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the actual cause of poverty / financial lack?

@SaintChemeleon Not truly desiring to make money.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What do mean by “Arriving”? Is arriving being?

@kevinthomaschen Arriving at the Ultimate

Coming to Permanence.

The end of all striving.

The end of all chases.

Realization.

Understanding.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How one can deal with regrets?

@elims_smile You cannot really "deal with" anything.

"Dealing with" is a shell game of the "new age" and  "self-improvement" industry.

@KapilGuptaMD What's the way to remove the sufferring of regrets? Actually, I partially know the answer. Thoughts have created the regrets. If there are no thoughts there would be no regrets....but removing the thoughts...

@elims_smile One must come to the realization that one's actions are an offspring of his understanding

The errors that one makes are not evil in their intent

They are errors of ignorance

Rather than errors of a "good" or "bad" person.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How important is it to maintain a schedule for every day?

@chunax "Important" has no universal meaning

Routine does tend to keep one away from destructive habits.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Who were your teachers?

@m_flynner None.

@m_flynner Except Life

And circumstance.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Does the mind intentionally create an ego/identity or is this due to society's conditioning?

@mmbe27 Mind cannot survive without ego or identity.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Dear Sir, I recently realized that bad karma is not only in acts but in mind/bad thinking too. One can avoid bad acts but how to avoid bad thinking, envy, jealousy from mind.
Any thoughts Sir.

@prashu125 Where there is a preservation of the Self

There will be a Mind.

Where there is a Mind

There will be the defilements you speak of.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, I find that spending my time fully engaged with my craft is not enough and there is a hunger for something about which I can't say much other than it seems beyond my reach and difficult to put in words.  what is this that I'm seeking?

@Charliek913 Different humans use different words

Permanence, satisfaction, peace, realization . . .

---

If a serious man objectively examines his life, he discovers that his entire life has been a series of lies, empty promises, prescription chases, and fleeing this and that.

If sincerity lives anywhere within him, he will understand that he must Arrive 

Before death arrives.

---

The world is chasing "mindfulness."**

**But Truth lies in Mindlessness.**

---

Examine the nature of your thoughts

And you will discover that they are always in search of a dose of pleasure.

Circumstances that you would like to go your way

And situations that did not.

This is your entire experience of life

There is nothing else.

---

The results an individual receives are not a function of what he “does”

They are a function of what he is convinced of.

---

When reading The Private Discourses

Allow not your mind to turn them into a prescription.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt This constant underlying need to disprove my insecurity in social situations, it's like I'm always coming from this place to disprove the fear inside of me. I see I'm often attached to a certain outcome and that causes a lot of the anxiety but it is automatic at this point.

@zoe_slows The Truth lies not in becoming Secure

It lies in viscerally and non-intellectually resting in the fact that insecurity exists within you.

Without the compulsion to fight it.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I struggle with the concept of creating the future because my entrepreneurial efforts feel like an attachment to a tomorrow. What should be understood about this self-conflict when my way of being doesn’t feel forced?

@rkroeger13 You are attempting to create a future based upon pleasure and reward

This is the cause of your struggles.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I see a possibility in my mind. But when I translate it to physical reality (writing) what I put on paper feels less grand and satisfying than the pure internal possibility did. It frustrates me. 

What is the nature of this situation?

@jaycrosstweets Your desire to produce/succeed/become validated

Is stronger than your desire for Purity.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt In living in an emerging economy seemingly always on the edge of a cliff, anxiety seems to try to drive one to safer, more stable jurisdictions. What is the truth around this apparent risk reward if one's talent is assumed to be around finding opportunities and growing businesses

@PhilMullerSA When reward is considered valuable

It becomes the hub of one's search.

This gives rise to the Anxiety

Of not achieving it.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt When I try to see all that the mind is doing, and all the ways that I am not it, is the mind still not the entity doing the seeing? How do I know when I experience something that is not mind?

@teebesz When there is no intellectualization

And no chase for happiness or pleasure or self-image.

---

The thing that can easily consume you for the rest of your life is The Thing

All else is done for empty pleasure

And this Forever leaves one . . . empty.

---

FINDING TRUE PEACE IN YOUR LIFE

No "working on yourself"

No "prescriptions"

No "exercises"

No "meditation"

No "spirituality"

No "forgiveness, apologies, gratitude, journaling, or love yourself"

Simply, The Truth.

---

A man is beginning to learn the Truth about life

When he is no longer surprised by anything.

---

A man’s most urgent necessity

Is neither happiness or money.

It is Wisdom.

For it is wisdom that he will need to navigate the turbulent waters of his day to day existence

Without succumbing to the ocean of turmoils

Or to the empty road of prescriptions.

---

It is easy to lose one's way in this society

Making oneself immune to the temptations of the Mind is more devastatingly critical than it has ever been.

---

The problem with Reward  
Is that it feels good.  
The problem with feeling good  
Is that it is pleasurable.  
The problem with pleasure  
Is that man enjoys it beyond compare.  
Thus, such a one is chained to hankering for a reward 
And, therefore, he is doomed to a life of anxiety.

---

KapilGuptaMD Why attachments are so attractive and interesting, apart from destructive ?  

@ZobairSiddique Because they provide the opportunity for pleasure.

---

The Simple Secret To Acquiring Genuine Wisdom:

He who has learned to view every situation 

Without the lens of "himself" or the "other"

Will find himself on the path to genuine wisdom.

---

The one thing that we, as humans, cannot afford

Is the incessant burden of Ourself.

---

Having an opinion,

A man will hold onto it.

Having held onto it,

He will become it.

Having become his opinion,

He will live forever in conflict

With the world

And himself.

---

Give not advice to your children

Give not help to your fellow man.

For wisdom lies not in Giving,

But in understanding the nature of human beings.

Keep all things to yourself,

Until the sincerity of the one standing before you

Leaves you no choice but to Give.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I add something to my task list: it is the kiss of death. Adding means I have promised myself that the action means something, and the significance frightens me, prevents movement. How do I organise myself with purity, without thought of outcome?

@maxaitken When the outcome does not mean so much to you anymore

Until that point, attempting to not think about outcome, while harboring a desire for it will create anxiety and lead to failure.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I fail to see the imaginary person that "I" am protecting etc...
I only know rationaly that it exists, through your discourses,
depsite the constant uncontrollable chattering in my head.
Any advice on what I must explore to break the illusion/belief?

@MatevzRopret That imaginary person is ego.

Do not attempt to rid yourself of it

Notice its patterns. 

And the sorts of turmoil it brings you.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Most of my problems would be solved by discovering Who I Want to be.

But for some reason, I don’t want to figure out what I “Want”. When I ask, I ask reflexively, instead of with Sincerity. 

Why don’t I Sincerely want to figure out what I Want? Is the Mind preventing me?

@aman_ramnani Yes 

But do not fight the mind

Discover what the mind wants.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt The stripping away of layers of truth leaves me with a sense of loss without clarity on what I am actually searching for. How do I navigate this while still physically living in the world and society around me?

@Ymindel Discover the emptiness in the things you have been thus far in your life been compelled to search for.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt How might one separate a pleasure chase from the pursuit of one's art? When might the pursuit of art become an escape or a chase? Thanks.

@arete_light Do not fear the pleasure chase

Pursue the art

If there is anxiety, there is a chase happening.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt What lets one viscerally see that, there is No Time and arrive at seriousness to stop procrastinating?

@danielpsegundo The natural death of the desire for pleasure

---

The single, discontinuous moment

Is all there is.

Memory haphazardly links them into an imaginary saga that one comes to know as “his life.”

---

**It is for this reason that the wise man lives the life of a recluse.**
 
**It is for this reason that the wise man speaks to very few human beings.**
 
**For there is only so much Truth that a societal man can bear.**
 
**How many layers of himself can he afford to burn?**
 
**How much of his life is he willing to admit is a lie?**
 
**How much of the house that he has spent his entire life building, is he willing to take a bulldozer to?**
 
**How many sacred cows can he condemn to the chopping block?**
 
**It is simply . . . too much.**
 
---

What most greatly contributes to a man's struggles

What blinds him to The Truth

Is the shadow of his own ego.

Not because it states that he is grand

But because it states that he exists at all.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Is everything the mind comes up with ultimately a distraction

@satts5 Yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I see that my preferences of like and dislike are entirely conditioned yet I am still at the whim of them, I suffer immensely when things are “that” way and not “this” way, and in trying to go beyond it I just bring more conflict. how is one to transform his default state?

@zoe_slows By understanding firmly that one is in that place.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt In examining anxiety, I recognize the “luxury” that living with it provides - I seem to thrive on managing its presence - it seems it gives me something to do - what is required to be free of this “addiction”

@michaeljbarry1 You gain too much pleasure from it to let it go.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master: How does one find his passion? That for which one get paid to play?

@Marcos80390591 If you had but 6 months to live, discover what precisely you would do.

@KapilGuptaMD I only find reactive answers such as "traveling, enjoy all my money, etc"

@Marcos80390591 You have not looked.

Because you are too eager to find "an answer."

---

@KapilGuptaMD What can we learn from suffering?

@Rmtpk1 You must stop reading spirituality books.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one find focus for his work?

@ty_wolf By first discovering desire.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Since all a human perceives is mind, how do we overcome it through the same mind?

@mmbe27 It is not about overcoming anything.

It is about seeing what is there.

This leads to Freedom.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do I keep going in circles and feel stagnant? Like im not moving forward just same place and feeling stuck/lost/sad #helpme

@JR98117 Because you have not discovered where it is you wish to go.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one measure success?

@MarkIacolina It is an empty word

Each person creates his own empty definition.

---

@KapilGuptaMD As more answers come to me, I only have more questions. Does this end? And if it doesnt end, being all part of the journey, where does it actually lead?

@ChucklezK Nothing leads anywhere.

The more refined and sincere the Question

The more it becomes an answer unto itself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one become so sure of their self to know that they are helping people and not destroying them? Despite what the people their trying to help has to say.

@ChucklezK As long as you are sure of "yourself"

You will destroy your life

And the lives of those around you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sometimes I have moments of pure clarity where the truth is obvious and the path is clear. But I don’t know what causes them. They seem to come on their own. Is it possible to be that way all the time?

@iwearahoodie Your desire to have them

Keeps them away.

@KapilGuptaMD yes. I couldn’t see that before. Now that you’ve said it it seems obvious. Thanks

---

@KapilGuptaMD Does the inquiry into “who am I” or “ am I aware” done with sincerity have the potential to reveal the Truth?

@iyerkum Anything done with devotion and sincerity has the potential to reveal Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I am likely as free and unbound as I will be in this life (single, have savings/time/health etc). 

I desire a meaningful use of my time.

You advise to discover/look/explore within to find that which we desire.

Would you expound more on how this is best done? 

Thank you 🙏🏻

@sivano The man who has everything

Has the greatest luxury in the world:

To devote his life to gain freedom from his mind

And discover The Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is life unpredictable?

@i_am_manishdas Why does the wind blow a leaf to the right, and not to the left?

---

@KapilGuptaMD Hi Kapil, why mind creates state sadness , emotion, angry for not fall into this trap what one must understand

@_ravi That this is the nature of mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I feel stuck. I no longer have any overwhelming desires, because I know where they lead. I don’t know what to do with the rest of my time. I don’t even have the need to do anything, but I find it preferable to nothing. How did you disover what you wanted to do with your life?

@jimmpierce There is nothing to do.

There is nothing to lament.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it possible to rid the mind of improper thoughts?

@Mirage5 No.

---

All teachers and coaches

In all domains

Succumb to giving prescriptions.

For if they do not,

They will have no students.

Thus, there is no effective teaching

And no effective student.

It is all, in the end,

A pretending.

A shameless waste of a human life.

---

The wise man speaks not to others
For this is fueled by a need to express one’s opinions
The wise man speaks not to himself  
For this is fueled by a belief in one’s opinions.  
If there is no opinion to propogate  
One naturally comes upon Silence.

---

From Twitter to Instagram  
From the tarnished bumpers of automobiles to the prettified lips of human beings  
The world is awash in:  
Do “X” and you will become “Y.”  
No intentional “X” ever leads to a natural “Y”  
This is the Truth that modern civilization has yet to discover.

---

When there is clarity within

The outside world appears clear.

When there is turmoil within

The outside world appears tumultuous.

What one sees externally

Is a reflection of where one is internally.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I’m a natural worrier. I tend to overreact about normal problems and situations that appear in my mind as worst-case scenarios. Any practical tool to deal with it?

@OtoMakanMai There is no way to "deal with" anything

For "dealing with" is like wanting to live with a fatal illness.

You may wish to consider this

If it resonates with you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD You recently tweeted 'man does not change'. Does this mean we all have the truth within and therefore you cannot change what you have within?

@maclarken It means that the manufactured self does not change

A man is as he is.

Truth lies in recognizing the non-entity that one is.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Whenever there is an insight,it gradually turns in to memory n then thought Comes from memory "trying" to mimic the insight, but doing the exact opposite n preventing the insight from http://happening.it seems like an impossible loop. Is there any way out of this loop?

@Aman23207529 The loop continues because you are seeking insights

In order to accumulate as egoic knowledge.

@KapilGuptaMD By insight, i meant when something is seen, then soon the thoughts gets activated from memory of the experience of that seeing, nowvtrying to repeat the seeing thereby prohibiting the seeing from http://happening.it seems to make it hopeless

@Aman23207529 If it needs to be remembered

It was not truly Seen.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is there a point where there is nothing left to realize or understand

@ShawnNirappil Yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why people believe in god?

@spectervsross In most cases, it is fear.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Hey Kapil, What is your view on sacchidananda state described in Hinduism? Thanks!

@Rohitrohitdesh States and experiences are temporary

They are a pleasure chase.

Unless one can live permanently within it

It is more empty games.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What would you say tonight to all the depressed minds of this world?

@jfsagasti You are neither good or bad

Life is neither good or bad

You will be rewarded

You will be scorned.

To seek one and avoid the other

Is to invite a torrent of disappointment.

What you see before you is all there is

What you think about it, is not.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you accept pain, caused by a disease or a heartbreak or anything else.

@mskd96 There is not a prescription in the world that will satisfy your question.

"Acceptance" tends to be forced acceptance

That which is not genuine, always falls apart.

Justice to your question would be to say:

The approach of seeking a how, or seeking relief

Is futile.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Who are three people dead/alive you would suggest reading their life about?

@Rohitrohitdesh Storybooks are procrastinations from the urgent matters of life.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How can I find balance between being creative and being rich enough to provide for my family?

@JamieJacksonati What matters to you most

Is what you will find yourself doing.

(The things you mentioned need not be mutually exclusive).

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the truth about helping another, when they are sincere, to arrive the same wisdom one embodies?

@jimmpierce It is generally the case

That one's own wisdom

Displayed in full flight

Is itself the Teaching.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I am very comfortable even when there's fires on all directions and I am seeing this. I have realized that I do not know anything and especially my want. What is the best way to find what do I want ?

@muthunagarajan1 If only you could find a way to live within the first half of the second sentence . . .

---

The choices of human beings cannot be attributed to them

For humans are not in control of their lives.

Their impulses, their compulsions, and their addictions

Choose FOR them.

Trying to overcome involuntary thought 

Or attain wisdom 

Or achieve enlightenment 

Is frankly disingenuous.

For this is simply a re-orientation of the pleasure-seeking mind away from societal materialism

Toward “spiritual” materialism.

When innocence reveals itself as the only way to make it through life, unscathed

You will lose all interest in the intellect.

---

He who lives in the shadows

Beneath the surface

Never showing his chest

Or daring to demonstrate his significance,

Attracts not the attention of the demons of misfortune.

Such a man eases through life

Unnoticed

And unscathed.

---

Volition is untruth

For it arises from the intentions of a Self.

---

That which is hard, is dead.

That which is intentional, is egoic.

That which is conclusive, is clever.

That which is formless, is innocent.

That which is nameless, is pure.

That which arises from non-thought is Truth.

---

The thing that one truly desires

Is the thing he finds himself doing.

---

Siddha Secret: GUARANTEEING SUCCESS

Experimentation guided solely by outcomes.

Devoid of all beliefs and opinions.

Closing off the mind from the world, and from one's own hopes.

The natural absence of happiness or despair.

---

Siddha Secret: ACHIEVING THE IMPOSSIBLE

Why does man not achieve The Ultimate?

Because for his entire life, what he has been exposed to are the failures of himself

And to the status quo of the culture that surrounds him.

He fails, because his Mind has been trained to fail.

---

The fool attempts to win through “competing”

The Master quietly sets all the conditions in his favor.

---

When a man turns his attention to himself,

He sees only problems.

This is because in the world of the self, everything is insufficient, and everything incomplete.

If a man resolved never to turn his attention to himself,

He would forever be free of problems.

---

A Place To Begin:

It is perhaps wise to ask little of Life and its People

To live as a gentle and inconspicuous human who is here for a short while

Weaves in and out of the lives of a few,

Asks nothing from them

Then one day,

Quietly retreats into the beyond.

---

The visceral and fearless realization

That a man's days are numbered,

That he is, in fact, going to die,

Is the single greatest shield

Against the slings and arrows of life.

---

Siddha Secret: Arriving At The Goal

A destination, having been willfully established

And rooted in the Mind,

Must then be forgotten.

The Arrival at this destination

Results from a devotional allegiance to the conditions

That will result in its inevitability.

---

It takes an enormous number of years

For a human to realize the limitations of "technique" and "data,"

And arrive at the conclusion

That all outcomes arise from the Mind.

Even the one who says "it is all in the Mind"

Does not yet truly understand

That it is all in the Mind.

---

Freedom is the conclusive understanding

That all things in one’s life

From the mundane to the sacred

Are temporary.

---

One may not know The Truth

But he may find his way to it by establishing what is not Truth:

Ego

Need

Hope

Fear

Attachment

Pleasure-seeking

Good and bad

Pride

Self-image

Spirituality

. . . Are Untruth.

All things in a man’s life are a charade

“Do good to others”

“Practice loving-kindness”

“Help the world”

“Forgive”

“Love one, love all”

The Truth is that these are a reaction and a cover up for what he truly feels inside

Let him state his raw feelings

All things in a man’s life are a charade

“Do good to others”

“Practice loving-kindness”

“Help the world”

“Forgive”

“Love one, love all”

The Truth is that these are a reaction and a cover up for what he truly feels inside

Let him state his raw feelings

The Truth is that he feels betrayed, unloved, disappointed, hurt, fearful

He feels confused about what is the “right” thing to do

He feels alone in the world

He feels uncertain about what he should do with the remainder of his life

Honesty,

NOT “spirituality” or “self-help,”

Is the way to Freedom

To Wholeness

And to Truth.

Namaste.

---

Siddha Secret: The Highest Of Heights

Man can achieve unimaginable heights

When there is no interference.

There is no interference

When there is no significance.

---

A technique is not something that you "practice"

A technique is not something that you are "taught."

A technique is something that you Find within yourself.

---

There are many things to learn

But very little to teach.

---

@KapilGuptaMD why do we have such an overwhelming desire for human interaction and approval?

@iwearahoodie The Mind knows only the ego.

---

@KapilGuptaMD When I feel anxiety I’m aware that it is just a physical reaction to the lies the mind tells. I succumb at times anyway. Is there a truth here I am missing?

@FreeMrktCptlst Your thought of it being "a physical reaction to the lies the mind tells"

Is intellectual.

The understanding has not rested in your heart.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I find myself stumbling into moments of mindlessness with more frequency, without the slightest hint of effort or intention. Is there something that will nurture whatever conditions have allowed this to blossom?

@jimmpierce Become exicted by it and you will fail

Covet it and you will not have understood.

Seek not an "experience."

Seek Permanence.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I’m currently living in a roommate situation which is uncomfortable for my girlfriend and I, but to move into a place of our own will be much more expensive.

I feel that it would be worth it, but I would like to try to stay longer to save money. How should I handle staying?

@greasy_cat Such questions have no answer.

For the question is not truly a question.

Give yourself permission to do what you have already secretly decided to do.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What makes life worth living, in the sense of Camus proposing “There is only one real serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide” ? 

Would you say it matters not if people choose to live or die, or would you suppose the simple act of living has innate worthiness? Or?

@brianduffytweet From the perspective of the events of one's life:

Fortune, misfortune, positive, negative, peace, conflict . . .

Life is not worth living.

Perhaps a deep interest in figuring life out

Or arranging the conditions so that one never returns for another life

This may be of value

---

@KapilGuptaMD How can one do his duty without getting disturbed by distractions - all the time? And to be specific,  how can one fight lust (probably the most basic and powerful desire) in face of duty?

@akhilam512 Fighting resolves nothing.

Fundamentally, a loss of interest

Or an idea that is of greater resonance

Must arise.

---

If the external circumstances of a man's life were exactly as he wished them to be,

He would indeed enjoy a dose of pleasure.

But this pleasure would soon give way to dissatisfaction.

Recognizing this,

One sees that external circumstances have little to offer him.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt What must be understood about the mind/something else in order to see why questions are such an effective way of seeing the truth compared to just be given a prescription/direct answer?

@MatevzRopret A Question creates the Path

Prescriptions remove one from it.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt After following prescriptions and seeing them not work, I immediately turn toward not following prescriptions as a reaction.

But not following prescriptions is a prescription.

How can I tell whether I’m stopping prescriptions via visceral Understanding or as a prescription.

@aman_ramnani Intentionally Not following prescriptions

Is a sign that you have not understood the Truth about prescriptions.

Prescriptions take one toward the How-To

The How-To takes one away from the very Thing he is trying to learn How-To do.

Do not memorize this

Understand, over time.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Is there any room for taking advice in discovering Truth, or is all advice a form of a prescription

@PhilMullerSA If it is Advice that steers one toward the futility of prescriptions

Or toward the Understanding that it is the Question that will benefit him,

Then certainly.

If it is advice in the form of What To Do,

It is futile prescription.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Is everything that is a “How to” (non mechanical) a prescription ?


@rugvedvaidya Yes.
But beware of condemning something on the basis that it is a How
Rather than upon the understanding that the How leads one nowhere.

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I have to admit I still understand your words mostly intellectually. 
My mind immediately is thinking that if not for how to , I may not have found your work. Doesn’t how to lead somewhere at least ?

@rugvedvaidya You are not ready for the answer.
The fever of the How will have to wear off.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt In removing myself from the presence of external prescriptions and attempting to See, I tend to automatically transform Truth into prescription (such as your discourses) - in doing so i lack understanding and sincerity?  I cleverly continue to pleasure chase?

@michaeljbarry1 Having been conditioned by the world for one's entire life

Virtually all humans who are exposed to The Private Discourses experience what you are experiencing.

Rather than rushing to self-judgment such as insincerity

You may wish to examine the perils of Prescriptionizing.

---

Any change that is the result of a Prescribed Action

Will change back.

---

A man spends his life attempting to impress another

For he seeks validation.

He seeks validation

Because he is not enough.

He is not enough

Because a “self” can never be enough.

---

The desire to “help”

Has the effect of

“Dumbing down” the Truth

And prescribing a technique or a method.

As such, the aim of “helping” is aimed at replacing “bad” feelings with “good” ones.

True Help lies not in providing relief

But in the freedom from having to seek it.

---

If one seeks to mend any problem or situation,

There is no harm in doing what he feels compelled to do

Or in saying what he feels compelled to say.

The possibility of harm arises

When he is convinced that it will work.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is analysis paralysis in a nutshell?

@UroojAlam In sports, it is over-emphasizing technique.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it possible for a seeker to go on a journey to discover the Truth or is the journey itself meaningless and only a mysterious unknowable and unpredictable hand decides who discovers Truth? In the latter case should one not attempt to seek at all?

@iyerkum It is not fruitful to do things according to advice or to "should's."

Any journey that is based upon something other than what he is genuinely compelled to do will not bear fruit.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is mastering a worldly sport like golf or trading a worthy effort compared to enlightenment or any worldly pursuit for that matter?

@conquer007 Enlightenment is just as worldly as mud-wrestling.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do you you encourage a person in worldly pursuit like golf or even running a company when you know at the end all worldly things are temporary? Please clarify

@conquer007 One can just as easily spend his life in a cave if one wishes

Doing things in line with one's talents and one's motivation is the natural thing to do.

Even living is temporary.

Thus, according to your argument, you could just as easily ask, "Why live?"

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is the search for the truth readily findable or sufferingly found?

@regexvariable It is impossible

For the one who asks such a question.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What do you think about age? Do mental faculties decline as one grows older? I am afraid to make a career switch as I am over 30. And honestly I never heard you mention age in any of your podcasts.Please enlighten.

@Alishah28507093 If one's decisions are based upon such factors, then he has a "choice."

So long as he has a choice To Do or Not To Do,

The desire To Do is not strong enough.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to deal with cognitive dissonance?

@Sullivan_8753 Discover The Truth

And you will not have use for opinions.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Thoughts on sports? Healthy entertainment or too great a distraction?

@DDavid3381 Opinions have no value.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does something known only intellectually come to be known viscerally?

@jimmpierce It depends upon the desire one has for knowing it.

@KapilGuptaMD Please explain.

@jimmpierce For the one who does not seek it, intellectualization is enough.

For the one who does, he will not stop until it is visceral.

There is no "how"

---

@KapilGuptaMD If financial freedom is a prerequisite for seeking permanent freedom from the Mind, which one is most effective:

Pursue a craft that makes one forget oneself, but would only be financially rewarding if one 'made it'

or choose a lower risk method w/ the sole purpose of making $?

@ItsMeRuairi It is best to do what one's talents are naturally suited for.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What questions would you ask and problems would you prioritise solving  (not specific to individual) if you were in your 20s today?

@DDavid3381 I would begin the journey of demanding evidence for each personal belief or opinion.

So that I may learn The Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one face someone's unexpected passing?

@garlicmepls Attempting to "feel better" is fruitless

It is not benefit you to attach a philosophy to it, or a way to "process" it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do i balance -at building a company- the personal ego and the necessity of 'self confidence', self trust to represent the best of the company. without creating an imbalance that may disturb others?

@DanielZunigaa 1) It is wiser for the company to represent You

Rather than you representing the company.

2) Confidence does not come from ego

It comes from recognizing the falseness and fragility of the ego.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to overcome addiction?

@nashsteviej When the desire to stop is greater than the desire to continue,

It stops.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sometimes I feel bombarded with thoughts. I literally want it to stop but I fail. Is there any thing can be done regarding it?

@raushan2020 Not in the manner that you are asking.

The most important thing that you can understand is that all of your questions seek Prescriptions in one form or another.

Thus, your questions do not benefit you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it more important to be comfortable with yourself or strive to be a better version everyday and keep building

@damn_its_hot_ It is most effective to understand that one is not his opinions, his beliefs, his intellect, his circumstances, or his environment.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do deal with fear?

@AmritYggdrasil "Deal with" is of little value

Rarely does one know what precisely he is afraid of.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What should one really have to do if he or she wants to bring a change every time I  go in a guilt that i am not working hard and it is not like I never tried but that tries turns out into failure.

@MishraRishabh38 The thing that one seeks to do must be clear

And the motivation for it must be True, rather than forced.

---

Unless a man's life has a known deadline

He will waste it.

---

All things are Mental

But they are not psychological.

---

All that we fear

And desire

And chase

And celebrate

And lament

Are not matters of our own creation.

They are but a habit of a Mind,

That has not only manufactured the searches

But the very seeker himself.

---

The desire to change the world is neither noble nor effective.

It is but a clever escape

And a welcome respite . . .

From peering into the murky depths of oneself.

---

Every conscious thought

Regardless of its content

Is the Mind's ingenious trap

To keep the human "thinking."

---

The man who objectively examines his life

Discovers that it is centered around a great lie.

---

All talk has become “small talk”

For human interaction is a game of concealment and showmanship.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What would you say tonight to all the depressed minds of this world?

@jfsagasti You are neither good or bad

Life is neither good or bad

You will be rewarded

You will be scorned.

To seek one and avoid the other

Is to invite a torrent of disappointment.

What you see before you is all there is

What you think about it, is not.

---

Should a man who is obsessed

Allow himself to become in the least way civilized

He is doomed.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the best way to self discipline? I just can’t get there as I keep doing things that don’t really serve me well in the end.

@Mirage5 Discipline is force

Forced things do not last.

Either there is a Desire

Or there is not.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, I seek to understand the truth viscerally. Not just intellectually. Does that result from a continuous revisitation of the truth?

@Sharan_Piave The things that you experience each day in your life

The emotional patterns that you experience

Each of these has a true source, a Truth.

If your desire is sufficiently strong

You cannot help yourself from searching for the Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why does a person have challenge in focusing on certain goal? Why its difficult to get a goal and stick to it?

@sushantdsahu Goals are based upon rewards.

They are rarely powerful enough to hold one's attention.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you live in balance between not “wanting” anything/knowing everything is a lie and actually pursuing + achieving goals?

@adrigoldie A thing can be done most freely

When it harbor no significance.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Yesterday you tweeted about becoming a legend. Is that compatible with becoming a sincere man and living a life unnoticed?

@maclarken It is dangerous to get caught up in ideas and images.

There need not be ego in becoming a legend.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you know if a decision based on gut instinct is correct?

@theodore_nit There is no correct or incorrect.

Any action or decision that is performed in order to solve a problem

Creates more problems.

Truth is the only thing that creates Freedom from problems.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to stop letting useless thoughts take you over?

@naaze_e If they take you over

You do not deem them useless.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What’s the mind’s purpose in preventing us from seeing reality as it is?

@mmbe27 In order to survive.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What happens when the mind is silenced?

@CER0_ZER0 One sees things as they truly are.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do deal with loss a loved one and extra responsibility that comes due to it?

@sahilduhan There is no dealing with it.

Follow the part of internal honesty

Rather than prescriptions

@KapilGuptaMD Sir, can u explain it in slight detail please.....I really need your advice at this time.....

@sahilduhan Honest with oneself about the way that he feels

Rather than trying to seek relief from feelings.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I took a devotion in kung fu & martial arts. I recently read one of your discourses on the mind's role in relaxation of the body. 

Since all things return to the mind, what must happen for the human's bodily movements to Consistently flow naturally and move with speed?

@danielpsegundo Freedom from a goal.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How can one intending singular focus towards greatness, or certain purpose, maintain familial relationships? 

Is it possible? Or is sacrifice required?

@cMacr0 Sacrifice is a flawed construct

Honesty about what one truly wants

Is the only way. 

Few are able to walk this path.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one tell the difference in true internal desires vs the ones society may have conditioned us to?

@rahulahuja Examine if it is based upon a prescription

---

@KapilGuptaMD Kapil I've read in your discourses that failure is not necessary but experimentation is, for a person to discover what he'll devote his life to he'll have to experiment doing various things, is that what you mean?

@cadelacru Truth is discovered through experimentation.

As for what you wish to devote your life to

It is likely already within you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Where does attachment arise from? What would need to be seen to prevent them?

@MatevzRopret Attachment is closely related to Need

Which is closely related to the search for happiness.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Do you think routines have any value in domestic existence? Is there such a thing called balanced life?

@iadivashi Routines can have some value

From the standpoint of organization.

The problem arises when one does them as a prescription.

---

Let it be known

That those who give you Prescriptions, Methods, and Hacks

For success, spirituality, self-development, or building empires

Are the silent enemy in your midst.

They are the reason you have been "searching" for your entire life

Without ever having Found.

---

@KapilGuptaMD So prescriptions are basically steps to a certain achievement or desire?

@Mirage5 All prescriptions

All "how-to's"

All "hacks"

Lead back

To the prescriptions, how-to's, and hacks.

They do not lead to thing being Promised.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is leaving the comfort zone/overcoming fear another prescription or can It be valuable to attaining deeper insights about oneself?

@monter_nicolas It is a prescription.

The second half of your question suggests that you are not ready to see it as such.

---

The greatest societal skill

Lies in conquering the need to be liked.

(By You)

---

Humans do Silly Things:

They go to a "school" in order to survive in the real world.

They are instructed about enlightenment from an instructor who himself has not attained it.

They practice things that have resulted in nothing but failure.

They tell children to focus on "good grades," when such a thing has no practical relevance

They discuss the quickest traffic routes to arrive at a job they do not enjoy

They do everything based upon tradition, prescription, and habit, without ever examining the Evidence.

They believe that this message applies to someone other than themselves.

---

The Most Sincere and Intelligent Man in the World

Is the one who closes the door,

And places upon the table,

All the ways in which he has been stupid

In which he has wasted his life

In which he has gone on empty goose chases

And in which he has been lying to himself.

---

The very instant that I get the feeling that a person is needing to be "convinced"

The conversation is finished.

---

Do you know for a fact that what you are doing is Effective?

Do you know for a fact that what you are doing will take you to your goal?

How do you know without a shadow of a doubt?

How ever your Mind responds to this

Will:

1) Be Defensive

2) Take you away from the Questions

---

"This too shall pass?"

Yes.

But it will soon be replaced by another "This."

---

There is so much that a human does not understand

Any conclusion he makes is bound to be incomplete.

Mistrusting his own opinions

Is a natural movement toward Wisdom.

---

All forms of media

No matter how lofty or intellectual

Are an entertainment.

No matter the purity of the listener's intention

No matter the number of notes that he takes

He is attempting to battle an internal default

Which is not affected by external causes.

---

Mental models

Loss aversion

Occam's razor

Probabilistic thinking

Second-Order thinking

Gaussian distribution.

Man is an escapist.

The instinctive fear that he knows nothing,

Compels him to manufacture Academic and Intellectual concepts

To camouflage his insecurities.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt The endless chase has proved only to lead to more chases.  To dissatisfaction.  There has been a shift in understanding yet having been conditioned to chase for so long I continue... when there comes an end to all chases there remains space for Purity and talent to arise?

@michaeljbarry1 All chases come to an end
When one becomes Serious about ending them.

---

Throughout his life, a man does noble things and hurtful things. He spends his life encouraging himself to do the former, and condemning himself for having done the latter.

His transformation lies in the abandonment of all self-judgments.

So that he may live Image-less and Free

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I struggle with what you discussed in a solo podcast about "the achilles heel of the artist" -- wondering what others think of my art and the Need for validation and praise. 

Why do I have these needs and what role are they serving? 

Thank you Kapil.

@danielpsegundo Mind is ego.

Ego craves validation, praise, recognition, acknowledgement.

---

Every human interaction,

From the smallest to the largest,

Is an attempt to display one's ego.

The ego of the "Knower"

The ego of the "Good Student"

**The ego of the "Learned Reader"**

**The ego of the "Helper."**

**If ego was banned**

**Humans would stop interacting altogether.**

---

**Every social gathering**

**Is a Twelve-Step Meeting in disguise.**

It is critical to Understand,

That one's spouse, children, parents, friends, colleagues, and priest

May do things for him, and have good intentions at heart.

**But they will, forever and always,**

**Prioritize themselves over any other.**

This Truth can set one Free.

---

The man who is charitable and benevolent

Is infinitely more attracted to the intoxicating feeling

**Of maintaining a self-image of "being Benevolent."**

Than he is to the Effects of his benevolence.

---

A man who is busy making Conclusions

Becomes blind to the Evidence.

---

Words of a Wise Man:

The first third of my life, I thought IT was "There"

Having not arrived at IT,

The second third of my life was a resentment against those who told me IT was "There."

In this final third of my life, I see that it was my need to "follow" that led me astray.

---

A morning talk with my younger son:

"If we operate according to The Truth", we flourish

If we operate against The Truth, we suffer

I will not give you Prescriptions.

As I told you when you were small,

It is my job to show you the room

It is your job to find your own corner."

---

He who takes Notes

Acquires very intelligent . . . Fingers.

---

The greatest Truth is,

I Do Not Know.

The greatest Lie is,

Feeling "humble" for having said it.

---

No man in human history

Genuinely Desired a particular thing

But waited for someone to tell them "how to get it."

---

Rain falls outside my window.

One could spend a lifetime examining it

For it is real, it is here, it is wet, and cold

One need not speculate about it

Or wonder if it exists

Or work toward it.

It is real, it is here

It is Truth

And thus worthy of one's time.

---

If intellectuals, having read their greek philosophy, buddhist literature, and scientific theories

Were banned from telling others about the knowledge they acquired,

They would lose interest.

There is nothing in modern culture or society

That is not squarely centered in Ego.

---

The path of striving and achievement leads only to endless frustration

Pure Mastery of craft and of Mind

Is the only sustainable joy and satisfaction.

---

Greatness

Arrival

Truth

Are by their very nature and essence,

A steady retreat from the world

And its people.

It is this very fact

That makes them so extraordinarily rare.

---

What is Perfection?

Non-interference.

---

A Serious man asks himself

What is it that I Know,

That contains not a TRACE of opinion or belief.

(Not an invitation for responses)

---

Seek not reciprocation from "people"

For there is nothing in this world to be gained from any person.

The credits one has attained through Sincere acts

Will be reciprocated by Nature.

---

The man who moves through life

Keeping his associations loose

With even those he professes to “love,”

Acquires the eyes 

To see things as they are.

---

A person who is wise in his teens

Will avoid other teens.

A person who is wise at any age

Will avoid groups of any kind.

---

Ego is suffering

Parenting is suffering

Relationships are suffering

Competition is suffering

Striving is suffering

Hope is suffering

Pleasure is suffering

Suffering is suffering

Life . . . is suffering.

Seeing that it cannot be otherwise

Frees one from suffering.

---

It will most benefit man to hear these messages

Rather than to listen to them.

To think about

To decide

To ruminate

To contemplate

To reason

To conclude

To process

To justify

To reconcile

To accept

To do

To be

To rationalize

To come to terms with

Is the workings of the Mind.

The Truth is found not in these domains.

---

Boredom is a constant companion of the Super Successful

A critical thing to understand about boredom is that it has no permanent solution

For it is not a condition, but a sign.

A fish feels cold only when it is out of water

Man only feels boredom when he is out of the Moment.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do humans indulge in fantasies rather than the truth?

@CER0_ZER0 Pleasure. 

Escapism.

---
@KapilGuptaMD When the suffering is full spectrum & saturated (complicated grief, chronic disease, job loss, solitude), what is the path - just to be with that suffering until the light of consciousness gets snuffed out?

@stoictheghost1 Understanding that life is suffering 

And seeking happiness is illusion and fruitless

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the hardest aspect about getting to the truth?

@AleksTsatskin Desiring it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD If I’ve found someone in my craft who speaks truth is it safe to learn from them at a distance?

@omisegoodness Filter their words through your instincts

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to turn anger into peace?

@cryptoKoincash Emotion is tied to ego

---

@KapilGuptaMD Coming to realize some of the truths deep energy (which I preserve to be anxiety) comes up. Is this the ego causing this energy, since, the truth disturbs stability?

@KG254123 Truth can create fear.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sir how to overcome laziness??

@saurabhp29 You cannot overcome something without a natural desire

No prescriptions.

---

Growing attached to family

One becomes complacent and careless.

In loosening emotional attachments

One becomes appreciative and graceful.

Truths:

Independence creates Freedom

Becoming strangers creates relations anew

That which one "owns," he destroys.

---

The waves on the open ocean

Are not beautiful.

They are Truth.

---

News, magazines, statistics, books, articles, television, radio, podcasts, instructors, coaches

Create messages for the widest possible audience

They cast wide nets to acquire popularity and “business”

They thus have no power to transform any unique single human being.

---

He who attempts to tame the ego

Acts from the very thing he seeks to tame.

If one is to move away from ego

Let him not proceed as one who seeks to slay a monster

But as one who has discovered that this is precisely what the ego has made him into.

---

“The things I have learned through direct experience are many. But they will not benefit you”

- Siddhartha Gautama

Should a man open his mouth to respond to what is not in his direct experience, he acts from empty intellect.

Quiet Exposure

Without compliance, or discussion.

---

The psychiatrist gives man a pill

The psychologist, counseling

The motivationalist tells him to act

The spiritualist tells him to meditate

No one has really heard this man

They have exiled him into therapeutic escapism

They have given him everything

Except The Truth.

---

One of the secrets of Life

Is to truly experience

The accessible Present,

Before it becomes

The inaccessible Past.

---

It is most wise and fruitful

To keep one’s dealings

Directly with Nature itself.

Rather than with its middle men

Known as human beings.

For nature knows what is in a man’s heart.

Sparing him

From a life of hope, need, and dependency

Upon the fickle heart of man.

---

If it creates excitement, it will collapse

If it creates anger, it will collapse

If it creates hope or need, it will collapse

If it relies upon reciprocation or specific action from another, it will collapse

If it creates freedom, dispassion, or indifference

It holds promise

---

Siddha Secret: Goals vs Visions

Setting realistic and achievable goals

Recruits the capabilities one currently possesses.

Creating an Insane Vision

Shocks one's Mind

Into creating capabilities that he did not possess only moments ago.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is the pursue of growth yet another trap of the intellect and the mind?

@SynphZ It is a pursuit of a new self-image.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one get rid of negative thoughts and demons that drown his mind? 

He’s stuck. He can’t move. Day in, day out.

@availabledog Negative and positive are the same.

@KapilGuptaMD @availabledog Are negative and positive both imposters?

@TweetNarrative @availabledog Yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one find a sense of purpose?

@availabledog There is no purpose.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why are most of my actions in life motivated by receiving approval or validation from others?

@RyanT27529647 Appetite of the ego.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have long wondered why there are few female enlightened models. In any field. How do we change this? Can u pls answer? Are we not all one? Can we not all be seen and included in the legacy & creation that is humanity.

@ArupaTesolin Male and female are irrelevant

There is only Human.

You have been infected by false views

This is costing you greatly.

(I have no recommendation that you change)

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to cultivate sincerity?

@SteppeBrahmin Sincerity arises when genuinely longs for the Truth about a thing.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Does loneliness come with freedom?

@T_Ball5 Every human being is Alone.

The manner in which you are asking the question

Suggests a cost-benefit analysis.

If so, it will lead you nowhere.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Where do our notions of right and wrong come from?

@iwearahoodie Adhering to a self-image

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why can’t I find true happiness?

@wienickwooden Happiness is the sister of misery.

One cannot exist without the other.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one who he is, what he wants? Is it normal for someone to stay confused about all this?

I know people say let your actions decide, but even to do that, you've to know which direction you want to act in?

@mohityprakash If one looks inside

With sincerity

The answers are there.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Im relatively young. I got a cancer diagnosis two days ago. Caught early. Waiting to hear next steps. Potentially curable.   While I am not on the floor in a ball I am anxious. My mind sometimes goes to worst case scenarios. Fear.

@norahankins1 I understand.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do I let go of the need for approval?

@walkerfrench There is no letting go

There is only the discovery of the cause of its existence.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is compassion?

@Android_Kim The seeds of its arrival are the only true matter

In almost all cases,

It is a prescription that is followed

A "spiritual" rule one attempts to live up to.

Thus, has little to no relevance.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have never smoked or been attracted to smoking. A sudden curiosity has arisen, and I experimented with my first few cigarettes this week. I’m 28, and value healthy living so don’t want to make it a habit. Why this sudden temptation? What am I not seeing?

@dhruv_toshniwal Mind is the devil.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is beyond objective reality?

@azijira_ First discover objective reality.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Does Truth reside in no-mind?

@TweetNarrative Yes.

But No Mind will likely be a chase.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Kapil, could you share some insights as to what is the source of attachment? Specifically, attachment to material things (money) and to other humans (emotional attachment)... thank you.

@Zoroaster88 The belief that things can be made permanent

The addiction to the idea of happiness.

---

That which the ear hears

That which the eye sees

The Mind becomes.

A man is a product of his most consistent exposures.

---

The world,

The Mind,

Is but a cackling macaw.

Chasing blindly after pleasures

Gorging itself in endless thought

Prostrating in desperation at the feet of hope

Begging at the altar of happiness.

There is No One

There is Nothing.

---

To free oneself from problems

One must first free oneself from the fix.

---

In any problem of life

All that the Mind speaks

For you or against you,

Explaining it this way or that,

Has not any significance

Or Truth.

It is this

That one must come to understand.

---

Nothing marks a novice like “Certification.”

Authentic is for the Authentic.

The Master is for the one who must become a Master.

This world consists of cosmesis for those seeking cosmetics.

The Authentic man,

Finds no home in this world.


---

Central to the failure of humans to achieve Peace, Freedom, or Enlightenment is their uncompromising need to receive from, and depend upon, others.

Their frank incapability in entertaining any and all Truths that imply or hint at an Isolation from, or Indifference to, the world.

---

In any problem of life

All that the Mind speaks

For you or against you,

Explaining it this way or that,

Has not any significance

Or Truth.

It is this

That one must come to understand.

---

He who is devoted to Truth is ever cognizant of the way things are. He sees life's indifference to his preferences. He sees his beliefs being dismantled. He sees that he owns no one or nothing. He sees that all attachments have left him destitute.

Such a man, discovers Freedom.

---

For the man who Thinks:

Thought creates his life

It creates his stories

It creates his self-image

It keeps him in bound to a lifelong state of fixes and putting out fires.

It is the only existence

He will ever know.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the root cause of a mind absent of clarity?

@CER0_ZER0 Belief in a self.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Should we observe great art as well as make it? Is it frivolous for us to spend our time consuming art rather than making it?

@FreeMrktCptlst It is best to do what is in one's heart.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I’ve seen you use the analogy that you can see certain dim stars out of your peripheral vision, but if you look directly at them you lose them. Why is it that when you focus directly on a thing like working on your swing, you eventually lose it?

@samjgillis Technique is not the game.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What does repeated self sabotage by individuals mean?

@rahulnaththakur A lack of examination of one's greatest visceral priority.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do I let the mind win/(for example lust) even though I know It is a game that cannot be won (theres always someone new, etc..). It seems like whenever I stop doing one thing (drinking) another 1 pops up that gives me pleasure but ultimately takes away my focus and freedom

@theproksa Intellect, health, and rule following is no match for the Mind

---

@KapilGuptaMD Kapil, you once said: “Man forever defaults to its defaults.”

When a human experiences such a thing, does it mean Desire and Sincerity weren’t truly there in the first place?

@Zoroaster88 One's defaults are based upon his level of understanding.

This is where he will forever return to.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I consume much more than I produce, which means that I don’t actually want to produce. I still think I should stop consuming and feel bad after consuming, which means I don’t actually want to consume. Where does this leave me?

@__dylanc Inside the loop of the intellect.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Kapil,

In addressing the man who Thinks,

Is he only able to view his life through the lens of his thought? Or is there a way out of his incessant suffering?

I ask because I tire of fixes and putting out fires

@Linnersverse He views solely through the lens of thought.

The end of suffering arrives with the end of Self.

---

@KapilGuptaMD If you really want something and are taking steps towards it , does universe really conspire to help you achieve the dream?

@TheCryptoDost If it is genuine, pure, and true

Yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you find peace?

@ohhmissmarie By understanding that all your desires

Are for naught.

---

How do I rid myself of problems?

You cannot.

Problems will live as long as you do. 

They will follow you on vacation. They will follow you to the restroom, the workplace, the bedroom, the temple, and the spiritual retreat.

Try as you might, you will never get rid of them.

---

There is No:

Right track/wrong track

Improvement

Progress

Failure

Success

Perseverance

Hard work

Positivity

Trending

Cap feathers

Trajectory

These are but things that humans have invented in order to make themselves feel good.

A man has Arrived

Or he has Not.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How one can create harmony with reality?

@Oxy_Smoker By losing interest in belief, pleasure, and opinion.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I need to know. What is not a waste of time.

@regexvariable Anything that is done for Arrival

Rather than pleasure.

Anything that is done from a place of Truth

Rather than from belief or opinion.

---

Rare and serious humans do exist in the world.

A seriousness that gives birth to a Question whose very formation begins to transform the questioner.

These have not surfaced today.

Perhaps next time . . .

---


One may do what he wishes. From the acceptable to the unthinkable.

If he does it to acquire happiness, or escape pain, he will be tormented by mind and conscience.

Try as he might, he will never convince himself or others of his goodness.

Truth lies in the absence of doership.

---


Nature would be wise to create a virus

That produces not fever or sickness

But a sudden loss of speech.

Not all the industrial pollution on earth

Can match the noise pollution of empty cacophonous human speech.

---


If there is a thing to become fearful of, it is the Self. 

The Self is a crucible of hardship, pain, evil, struggle, and endless confusion.

The cautionary tale of mankind.

To retreat from the Self, without the slightest pride or humility for having retreated from it

Is Truth.

---

The acceptability of suffering

Keeps one tied to suffering.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What prevents a person to go in deep focus mode in their work? I mean I feel extremely focused sometimes. But why it's not always achievable?

@raushan2020 Because you view it as something to be achieved.

@KapilGuptaMD So, do I just let it be? So my goal should be to do my work not try to acheive the focus?

@raushan2020 You have now drifted into prescriptions.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Can one truly be free if one is in sentimentally attached to somebody?

@SamuelPadillaC It matters not.

If I said No, you would not break your attachment.

If I said Yes, you would feel relieved not to feel compelled to break it.

Such questions are not True.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one overcome the fear of failing in public?

@Ankit_One77 What you truly fear is hurting your ego.

---

@ShilpanP Stop speaking after your second sentence.

This is the Truth.

This is What Is . . . for you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do I reduce or control my ego, when I constantly recognize the adverse effects it has on my well being?

@TheBrockvillian The adverse effects are not yet adverse enough for you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Hello Master. There are a thousand questions I would like to ask, but when it comes to Q and A my mind goes blank and as soon as I type a question an answer pops up in my head. How do I know it is true? Is this normal (you had a blog about it but it finished with to be contd..)?

@theproksa 1) I do not write "blogs"

2) Every answer that your mind gives you is a lie

3) Every question that you ask, has an answer that will do little for you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD My most honest question at this point in time is "How do I know im on the right path?" I feel there is no way going back for me, but I know there is a different level of seriousness to be attained.

@theproksa There is no right path.

There is only the sincere, genuine path of Truth.

One knows in his heart if he is on this path or not.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is craft always something one does individually or craft can be things which are done with the help of external world

@beoverman The external world is the hindrance to anything pure and true.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the underlying truth about the anxiety I suffer due to my uncertainty about the direction my life is headed in?

@NethersTheorem The belief that your life should be headed in a particular direction.

---

Penance, austerity, meditation, mindfulness, worship, prayer, chanting, and all forms of "practice"

Do not take one to wisdom, enlightenment, nirvana, or the beyond.

The evidence of millions is before you.

"Practice" is an ulterior motive.

Lacking purity, one does not Arrive.

---

An attempt to rise, stand tall, persevere, be heard, defeat, feel empowered, become a role model, exhibit male/female power, and be known

Are attempts at self-celebration.

Such things are not borne of Purity or Truth

They are borne of Insecurity.

---

The entirety of a man's life is viewed through the lens of emotion.

Emotion is built upon a foundation of thought.

Incessant thought is a product of attachment to a Self.

The self is an imaginary character created by the Mind.

Thus, a man's entire life

. . . is Untruth.

---

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why i m not able to come out of any fear in life?

@sanoc720 Fleeing from an emotion

Exacerbates the emotion.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What’s the best use of our time, knowing the truth?

@YonatanLerner One must discover that which he would be willing to devote his life to.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I’m not looking for a definition but Is Truth an axiom or it (Truth) can be verified?


@__aesthete__ That which is not verifiable

Is not Truth.

He who uses "science" and the tools of the world

To verify Truth,

Is not equipped to verify it.

---


@KapilGuptaMD Had a conversation today with someone about the subconscious mind. I think this is just the past and takes us away from the now. I would say the subconscious doesn’t matter at all because every second is different and what happened even a second ago doesn’t matter. Your thoughts?

@FilipMusic15 The Serious man

Does not have such conversations with "people."

There is no real question amidst the words you have typed.

---

@KapilGuptaMD For the person hellbent on a vision, what stands most in the way of their lasting peace?

@revancisneros The pleasurable reward they are chasing.

---


@KapilGuptaMD How to overcome bad habits? I start on the right track but after a few days the old habits become overwhelming.

@meetindergill Behavior is a branch of a tree

One cannot affect the tree's root

At the level of its branch.

@KapilGuptaMD Is it possible to change at that level?
Thanks for your answer.

@meetindergill Stand in front of a tree, if you must

And ask yourself this question.

@KapilGuptaMD Time to plant a new tree I guess.
Thanks Kapil

---

@KapilGuptaMD I know you don’t use the word consciousness. Is mind same as consciousness? If there’s no mind, what’s the name of the thing there?

@dpalak The ever-present, intangible Knower.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is grief?

@jessefredericks The difference between that which Is

And that which one would like it to be.

---

@KapilGuptaMD There is a topic I feel pulled towards day and night. It recently became clear that I would have already written a lot about it, if not for significant discomfort about how someone else would react to it. 

Is being completely clear on this, the only “doing” of true value?


@jaycrosstweets The attempt to be completely clear

Would also be a doing.

Thus, it would lose its value.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I pursue empty chase after empty chase... I'm an incredible escape artist... I "do anything not to deal with that which is most pressing". Going in circles & feel disgusted that my situation is still "ok with me..." any attempt to change is chase? This Q a chase? ... stuck

@michaeljbarry1 Chasing pleasure

While avoiding pain

Leads only to pain.

It is this that must, by some organic means

Reach your innermost level of understanding.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to be more disciplined and consistent at work and study?

@i_am_manishdas Discipline is forced

Thus useless.

"Work" and "school"

Are a waste of time.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Was the notion of time created by our mind or time really exists?

@pep88343916 Time is thought.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I’m haunted by past events which causes restlessness and sleepless nights. What is the best way to overcome this?


@Beef_010 There is no way to overcome this.

The very desire to overcome it is your true haunting.

Allowing only the haunting of the past

Without superimposing upon it the desire to be free of it

Will cause it to lessen over time.

In ways that you cannot orchestrate or predict.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do attempts to “fix” one’s problems only worsen them?

@jimmpierce Fixing is fleeing.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the secret to mastering a skill that is highly complex, like guitar playing?

@Hilomh The secret is to discover the Truth.

The Truth about your sincerity to learn it

The Truth about where you wish to take it

The Truth about playing without any interference whatsoever.

(If you take lessons, you have not a prayer).

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do I gain the courage to rely on myself and not others?


@theOG_MarySue It does not require courage

But understanding.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I understand there is only truth. 
If one feels within their heart a truth to be true, and by way of 'evidence' provided by the universe these truths are verified, then are these truths indeed confirmed?

@McGownJamesM Truth creates silence within the human.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is there a truth about oneself that is always verifiable? I am struggling with this question.

@iamvishanth Every Truth is verifiable.

But not by traditional means of verification.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I am experiencing physical pain from a sports injury. Can it be beneficial to follow a doctors/gurus prescription for rehabilitation?

@SeanRooney19 Yes.

Although the Truth about recovery is not known in the West.

---

No "self-help" or "spiritualist"

Will understand this.

For their high horse, is much too high for reality.

And no one in the world will dare to say it.

In today's age,

The single most definitive marker of Seriousness and Sincerity

Is Money.

---


"Help humanity, create meditation apps, and change the world."

If Sincere, such a man may wish to ask:

From where does his desire to "help" truly arise?

Have smartphones enlightened human lives?

Has meditation given him nirvana?

What is this "world" that he seeks to change?

--- 

---

Man spends his entire existence, fighting for various freedoms within the corridors of his life.

His only true freedom

Is freedom from himself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Best advice you ever got?

@KingDavidAttih Advice has no value.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is meditation the only way to find lasting peace? Also, any tips for self love and how not to yearn for it (love). Thank you!

@Hussain_Kagzi I do not know where to begin.

You must be new to these parts.

Your questions are so steeped in illusion, you are not in a position to imbibe the Truth.

@KapilGuptaMD What is the Truth. I’m sorry, this may sound naive, but like you rightly pointed out, I’m new here. Also, where do you recommend I start from?

@Hussain_Kagzi It will do nothing for you at this stage.

But . . .

Meditation will take you nowhere

Lasting peace is a pleasure chase

Self is an illusion

Love is a societal fabrication

There is no How

---

@KapilGuptaMD Does sincerety come before seriousness? Or are they parallel constructs?

@teebesz They may be used synonymously.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is it that when I allow myself to feel and think whatever I want (instead of trying to change it) it suddenly becomes silence?

@vvsork Because you have ceased fighting with the mind.

Beware of admiring the arrival of silence.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In yesterday’s discourse, it mentioned a rare individual could let go of the good as well as the bad. If masses let go of the good, wouldn’t we have no one to “help” those in need or in crisis such as natural disasters?  Wouldn’t this be a bad thing for mankind?

@FalconAndria There is no mankind.

The masses are irrelevant.

There is only You.

(Beware of such escapist tendencies of the mind).

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is money the single most definitive marker of Seriousness and Sincerity?

@maclarken Humans proclaim to give their effort, their time, or even their lives.

But if asked for their pocketbook, they tuck their head and hide.

Money is the most direct and reliable indicator of one's Sincerity in modern man.

It is his final line of defense.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do we get clear on removing things we believe ourselves to be? I'm reading Direct Truth now and feel deeply moved by it. But I feel lost in finding who I am (truly). For years, I've thrown myself at my career (and been relatively successful). And don't know what/who I am now

@allenrb365 It will take years to realize this:

Everything your mind tells you is a Lie.

Every thought you have is a disturbance.

All that you seek is an empty pleasure.

Any prescription or austerity that you attempt, will cause you to sink deeper into the quicksand of your life.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Are my dreams telling me something?

@iamjwm_ I do not know.

And it matters not.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is the individual pursuit of anything essentially a non acceptance of what is?   If so is this a cause of suffering?

@TheBrockvillian If one truly desires something

Naturally, he must allow himself to pursue it.

@KapilGuptaMD If pursuit of desires causes suffering, than essentially suffering is unavoidable.  Is acceptance of suffering the only way.   Is this truth?

@TheBrockvillian Suffering is unavoidable

If one lives as a Self.

---

@KapilGuptaMD The more I think about what is true and what is not, the more lost and confused I feel. Sometimes this makes me even feel like I‘m losing my sense of reality. Is this part of the path?

@LaurinPaech If a path requires faith

It is false.

You are using the Mind to find Truth

Mind is a torrent of confusion.

@KapilGuptaMD and thats how it feels like. Thank you for your reply. How else would I find truth if not by using my mind?

@LaurinPaech Understanding.

Understanding that the Mind speaks nothing but lies.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, which is a good start to free from mind?

@RamonVasquezM Discover what you are chasing.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Can you please elaborate on why a rock that falls upon the earth and makes three quick sounds is a true answer? Is the direct truth in that answer self-observation and self-inquiry? To ultimately realize the illusion of the self?

@m_flynner Truth be told,

There is perhaps not a single person who will understand that.

Any attempt to explain will be futile.

It will come, if and when it comes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is any form of attachment - be it to a person, or a community, or one's morning coffee - a hindrance to the truth?

@iywriter The answer that you fear

Is the Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Kapil, my Mind is constantly rationalizing and intellectualizing things... what does it mean to truly See?

@Zoroaster88 See what you have written.

You have written the words

But they have not registered in your being.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one make sound decisions?

@nashsteviej It is not about being “sound”

But about decisions that create no future problems. 

This is what the world has not been taught.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, is anxiety a lie?

@TylerNishida It arises from self

Which is a lie.

---

Feet planted firmly on the earth

No belief, opinion, attachment

No expectation or hope

A whole-hearted devotion of one’s life to Truth in a particular domain

Intimate relation with the unremarkable and dispassionate Moment.

This should lead to a pure Heart and a clear Mind.

---

If a human does not know Precisely where he desires to go,

His mind drifts towards empty intermediaries such as "working hard," "improvement," and "progress."

If a human knows Precisely where desires to go,

His only standard of judgment is

Has he yet Arrived?

Or has he not?

---

Need arises from a craving for pleasure.  
Craving for pleasure arises from the Mind.  
The Mind arises from an attachment to the self.  
Need, in all its forms,  Is the ultimate imprisonment of man.

---

Let a man discover the one true talent that nature has delicately entrusted to him.  
Let him devote this life he has been given to the full realization and maturation of this talent.  Becoming a Master in this one thing  
Will allow him to know all things.

---

Four important questions about your desires:  
1. What do I genuinely want?  
2. Why do I want it? Where’s this desire coming from?  
3. What will be the cost of achieving this desire?  
4. Am I ready to pay the price?

The realization that the cell phone provides no satisfaction.

The ability to sit,

Without meditating or thinking or doing or trying to self-improve.

The ability to become a nameless human organism without a history or a chase for pleasure.

This is Something

(And Nothing).

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one treat success and failure the same ?

@dawnvarghese By arriving organically at the understanding that neither gives him anything that lasts.

---

@KapilGuptaMD On the journey towards Understanding....is Exposure to Truth more important than pondering/ruminating on something with the aim of such pondering eventually leading to Understanding?

@iyerkum Yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one avoid the desire to follow topics just because your coworkers do and is all they talk about. Creating a awkward situation where I have very little in common with them.

@AmritYggdrasil You do not truly seek to avoid them.

Your desire to be part of the social environment is greater than your desire to be free of it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do I find my purpose?

@vicdetoni One cannot find what does not exist.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is desire something which one is born with or can be cultivated? The desire to be great, rich or win  has it played the most important part in those on the path of arrival?

@won_dr_km Desire exists within the hearts of all men.

The desire to create a desire is also a desire.

You may wish to discover that which drives you.

It may exist in ways other than success or materialism.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I'm always confused between doubling down on what I'm naturally like and striving to be this ideal image I have of myself in my mind. Thoughts?

@singh_abhas_ Your desire for self-image will overshadow all else.

There is no way out of this.

Until you grow tired of self-image.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one deal with a disease which has no cure and move forward with life?

@cryptooo_goat Any attempt to make one feel better or uplifted is false.

We are all terminal.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the human able to call himself a master of? 

The bird is a master in being a bird and everything it takes to be one. I am not able to find an answer for a human. 

Appreciate your answer.

@Den_Ko_ Becoming a nameless, thoughtless organism.

---

@KapilGuptaMD why is the mind always in search for pleasure?

@Anejagaurav To feed the "human persona" it has created.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I am at peace.
I don't desire seeking anything anymore - No truth, No money, No pleasure etc.
I feel this is my natural state.

Is there anything more to life or is this ignorance?
What if I die without truly living?

@Angel92234709 A life of no desire

IS living.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to leave a addiction??

@iamsushant30 When the desire to leave it

Is greater than the desire to remain with it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I recall you saying something of the kind: “a human must die several times in a year to be, and remain, free of the Self”.

What is it in a human being that compels them to die in this manner?

What remains of this death?

@nourbeam A genuine disenchantment with himself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In your understanding of things, what can you comment on the accurate nature of reality?

@RushiThorat09 Reality is that which is devoid of all thought.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the best way to tech my child to be happy and grateful?

@jbarbs8 He who learns intimately about himself

Becomes the teaching.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I wish to be insincere at times, what's the harm?

@Gunnisonnc If one feels there is no harm,

His desire to do so is greater than his desire to avoid harm.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Living in no-mind is infinitely better that with the wrecked persona that I still identified with most of the time. That persona still exist by a lack of truth? Will one day after x amount of time living in truth fade away? or it will exist somewhere, waiting to grow back?

@marvrafa A thing happens by way of Sincerity and continual Exposure.

All desires for progress and pleasure

Keep one bound in misery and confusion.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one wrestle with the balance between the desire to be independent and the suffering from loneliness?

@brianbarr_ The person who suffers from loneliness

Cannot be alone.

He who cannot be alone needs the company of others.

He who needs the company of others can never know Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Every time I draw something, my drawing looks so lifeless and rigid. 
Why does it happens?

@ishiaki_ A reflection of the state in which one draws.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have not arrived because I have internal conflicts everyday. Whenever I’m aware of my internal conflict, I want to read your work. How would I know if this is a genuine desire(what naturally arises within me) or a urge to ease the pain of internal conflict(chasing pleasure)?

@__dylanc You have turned Truth into rules.

Look starkly at the rules you have created, in the words you have just written.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is there a way to observe our thoughts such that we see where they come from?

@mmbe27 Why do you wish to observe your thoughts?

Why do you seek to know where they come from?

@KapilGuptaMD @mmbe27 This response truly has me thinking...

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it that if i will leave my job and live a low life then i will be able to live a good life

@sanoc720 Anything done for a future promise

Becomes a lie.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What's the truth about discovering my life mission?

@cadelacru When you die,

The sun will rise,

The oceans will flow

All will go on with their lives

As if you never existed.

Now you may find your "mission"

If you wish.

---
@KapilGuptaMD I'm always training/learning skills but missing moment when should stop learning and just do it. What i am doing wrong?

@PeekaboogzZ Seeing

IS the doing.

@KapilGuptaMD I'm fooling myself that i'm trying hard, but doing "nothing"?

@PeekaboogzZ You are fooling yourself

That "doing"

Means more than Seeing.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is unchanging?

@EquanimousMast1 The non-self.

---

Freedom lies in seeing that every pursuit concocted by the mind is an attempt to adorn the self. To add a layer of significance to one's existence. In order to quell the suspicion that one's life may have no meaning. And that one may, in fact, have only ten years left to live.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to just BE.. mind goes at million things at a time. Don’t know how to just B with all that’s happening in mind

@pingmrjay The desire to "just be"

Is yet another chase for pleasure.

It is a disguised form

Of what you are seeking freedom from.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Are all the answered I seek inside myself?

@b_bcurbelo21 Yes.

But they do not come in the form of answers.

---

@KapilGuptaMD When I observe my mind and impulses, who is the one observing my mind and impulses?

@KyleMillman Ego.

Thus, of no value.

Beware of spiritual tenets.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I wish to understand my own nature, as well as that of the universe. I suspect that these two desires seek to answer the same question. I think science is the path to get there. Am I wrong?

I don’t know why I desire this; it seems intrinsic.

@orthogonus If you think that science is the path to get there,

There is nothing that will satiate you.

A scientific mind cannot see Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I am in a meeting at work. I am bored and confused. Is there a wisdom for me?

@nurijanian Meetings are a waste of time.

"Work" is a waste of time.

If you must go to the meeting

And if you must "work" for money,

Then knowing it is a waste of time, but serves a utilitarian purpose for you

Will allow you to not seek from it what it cannot offer you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD does peace include pleasure? is there any peace in the chase for pleasure or desires?

@oliviagianella Pleasure produces pain.

A chase for peace

Is a chase for pleasure.

Thus, it also brings pain.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I know its a curious one, not a serious one - Do you ever edit your writings when you write discourses? Or once it flows, you just leave it as it is. Your writings have had profound impact on me.

@iadivashi I do not write them.

In essence, I am "written through"

---

@KapilGuptaMD What's the definition of Truth?

@MLQuotes1 That which is the indivisible heart of the matter.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do you do what you do?

@KapilGuptaMD Choice a prescription..

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is Truth - a state, a place, an action, a way? 
Is any characterization just prescriptive?

@m_reviere A quality of seeking.

A journey away from all prescriptions and actions.

Away from all opinions and beliefs.

Away from all thoughts and doings.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is truth subjective? And, is liberation ever obtainable?

@crespinky Subjective implies opinion.

Truth is devoid of opinion.

Liberation is not attainable for the one who wonders if it is obtainable.

@KapilGuptaMD Isn’t life a form of expression and if truth is nothingness does this imply only truth is found in death?

@crespinky A Truth that is found only in death

Is of no value to anyone.

There is nothing.

This is the ultimate truth.

(But it will not help you at this stage).

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is not a waste of time?

@PeekaboogzZ A genuine search for Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Kapil, I fear that my Mind will prevent me from seeing the Truth by imposing intellectualizations. How can one attain understanding when the Mind keeps on interfering? I feel a bit stuck in this loop (don’t truly know how to frame the question). Thank you.

@Zoroaster88 Understanding that the mind keeps interfering

Is a critical understanding.

A dog that barks in the distance does not trouble a wise man.

For it is in the dog's nature to bark.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to let go of any attachment?

@starrybytes When the pain of attachment is no longer bearable.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do i find my craft? I have no hobbies, juste Interest for a lot of different things. But I feel i’m just addicted to novelty. I would like to drop everything for one special thing but i cant find this special thing..

@domdidace It is

As it is.

@KapilGuptaMD Does it mean that im condemned or that It is in front of me and i cant see it?

@domdidace There is no need to seek a craft

No need to do anything.

If it arrives, it is natural.

If it does not, it is natural.

To be condemned

Is to hope for that which does not exist.

And to attempt to flee

That which does.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I feel I have no place, and it hurts. When I go "out of my way" to find it, forcibly, I feel I'm faking and it hurts. What to do?

@Kammotus1 Anything done by force

Leads only to trouble.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Can a person reach greatness in sport or business, whilst holding the understanding that it is all meaningless, or is delusion required?

@nomanmcm Seeing the meaningless in it

Allows one the freedom to pursue without anxiety or hesitation.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I think alot about quitting my job & trying to move 2 the city 2 do more things that I enjoy and love. Money always comes to mind as something I need, I feel uneasy if I leave my job & try and do what I feel is the truth for m How should I change things 2 be in order with truth?

@Bordegod It is not wise to use Truth as a rule.

It is not a must.

If the desire for it arrives, it does.

One must view practically the state of his situation.

What is before one's eyes, and most immediate

Is what is most in need of attending to.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why I´m always feeling I dont belong in this epoch and in the place I´m living? I do not want to do anything.

@JaimeRA00 It matters not why.

@KapilGuptaMD Then what matters? That I do not belong here?

@JaimeRA00 Nothing matters.

One feels the way he feels.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I’m trying hard to be as smart as you, but, boy, have set a high bar!

@BenBacon18 Intelligence is overrated.

Sincerity and Authenticity is underrated.

---

In the present, the future is a fantastical dream

In the future, the past is a nostalgic memory

If one learned to catch glimpse of the present's subtle transition into the past,

He would live and view the present

With the same fondness

With which he views the past.

---

Let a man,

Speak not of what he himself has not experienced.

Tell others to do what he has not accomplished.

Seek from others what he cannot give to himself.

Find faults in others that he himself suffers from.

Pursue Truth, rather than give or receive.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is success?

@shane_ewert Definitions are personal

Malleable

And irrelevant.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is choice an illusion because in every situation there is an option we desire more than the rest? Yet we tell ourself that we can't decide

@maydaytrade Yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is there fear of change.

@AmritYggdrasil Fear of pain.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to get out of broken relation in which you have invested yourself heavily in past?

@RIJUL008 Nature takes its course.

In one direction or another.

Holding tight to conclusions

Or to one's own moral superiority

Creates more problems.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do i have fear?

@human30602326 Because you have desire.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I get confused on intuition and the mind creating reality. Is this because of the mind reverting to duality?

@FalconAndria Reality is 

That one does not know.

---

@KapilGuptaMD If one seeks knowledge about a craft to show others how knowledgeable one is, does this mean one is pursing a false craft?

@themaxspence It matters not.

It matters only whether that is acceptable to him or not.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I wasted my 4-5 years mastering an art which I thought I was genuinely interested in only bcz I was good at it during my teenage years. Having stick to it for long time, I am good at it but not great (and no longer desire to become great at it). But I don't know what else to do.

@Angel92234709 Allow your motivations to lead you.

What appears will appear.

What does not does not.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Getting lost in one’s craft with genuine curiosity and immersion, what distinguishes this from any other pleasure chase?

@RecordMixDie Being lost,

There is no one to experience the pleasure.

---

@KapilGuptaMD At the end of a man’s life, which would he regret more... not pursuing mastery in a single craft? Or not being there to care for family?

@m_flynner It depends upon the man.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the root of constant anxiety?

@10xArt Self.

---

A thing done out of benevolence, backfires.

A thing done out of selfishness, backfires.

That which occurs spontaneously,

Neither preceded nor followed by thought

Creates not a consequence in the human.

---

Smart, dumb, handsome, ugly, fit, unfit, successful, or unsuccessful . . .

Indifferent to what he thinks of himself

He will be unaffected by what others think of him.

Freedom from self-image

Is the ultimate freedom.

---

Whether one realizes it Tonight

Tomorrow

Or one thousand lifetimes from now . . .

The only way to peace in a human life

Is when involuntary thought comes to an end

And the only thing that one is humanly capable of experiencing

Is this Moment.

---

There is no rainy day to save for

There is no tomorrow to shelter one

There is no reason to play anything safe.

Whether one makes it all, or loses it all

The day will absolutely and most certainly come

When he leaves this earth forever.

One must See and Feel

While he can.

---

One fateful day, 

The wise man

Comes to this sparkling realization:

"My opinions are stupid

My beliefs are stupid

My knowledge is stupid

My thoughts are stupid

From now on, I will keep my mouth sealed

For I cannot afford to waste a single minute

Of the life I have left"

---


He who intricately aligns every facet of his life with Nature,

Has neither the use or the need

For meditation, spirituality, diet, or a “healthy lifestyle”

---


The pleasure of fame and wealth invariably fades.

The satisfaction of creating Art

With a wholehearted indifference

Invariably endures.

---


A human does not know Truth

Thus, he resorts to the concept of Right and Wrong.

He does not know who he truly is

Thus, he resorts to the concept of Good and Bad.

Truth lies not in the domain of Knowledge.

It lies in knowing

That one does not know.

---

The cleverest stronghold of the ego

Lies in the intention to liberate "others."

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you overcome self-limiting beliefs?

@aj_jimenez7 All beliefs are limiting.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, I'm going to be blunt with you.

Have you ever tried pshycedelics and if so do you have anything to say about them?

@OMX2100 I have not.

They are beneath human beings.

I may soon begin to Block anyone who asks me about using drugs.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I understand that desire for Truth cannot be taught. It must come from the person who is willing to learn.

Did all your clients come to you already with burning desire? Or did they rekindle / reinforce their desire through the work they've done with you?

@made_in_cosmos What grows over time is Seriousness and Sincerity.

I do not accept anyone who does not have a requisite degree of these.

@KapilGuptaMD So Seriousness and Sincerity cannot be taught, but yet it increases in the people who work with you. What is it that you're doing to their perception that causes this?

@made_in_cosmos I do not "do" anything.

An uncompromising pursuit of Truth

Tends to create oceanic waves in human beings.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why can't a scientific mind never know truth?
@maclarken Because it seeks verification by tools that are too limited to know the Truth.

Most notably, the intellect.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Aside from survival, what’s the greatest motivator for change?

@bgyaboo Shame.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is it that no matter what decision I make, I experience some form of self-conflict or hesitation or regret afterwards?

@NethersTheorem Because you seek to make the Right one.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Namaste,
What are the tools beyond intellect which one could use to seek the truth?

@sherlockRG Truth is for the one who has grown tired of his intellect.

Unless one has reached this point,

Any pursuit will be prescriptive and methodological

Thus, ineffective.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I'm lost and confused...
I want to know something that worth to devote to.

What is the best approach to find a passion—or something like that?

(I don't intend to ask any prescription)

@hidematsune The harder you seek it

The more it will recede.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In what way does memory serve us?

@m_reviere In a purely day-to-day functional sense.

Nothing more.

---


We do not realize what we have until it is gone

Thus, it is wise to dismiss all conclusions and opinions while we have it.

---


There is no greater Elixir

Than needing not

And caring not.

(About one's own self).

---

One says the same things, to the same people, in the same way, on similar days, as the same person, thinking the same thoughts, experiencing the same feelings, having the same fears, the same anxieties, trying the same prescriptions, getting the same results.

---

Aristotle Onassis: "My father told me to carry a notebook. And when I meet a man, write down how much time he is worth."

Truth.

All humans that a man spends his time fretting over, are not worth the time.

Ultimate Truth:

One stands before a mirror

And pulls out his notebook.

---

Epiphanies are not valued for the thing being realized

But for the excitement for having realized them.

Both are short-lived.

---


Social interactions create a sense of "happiness"

And leave one with a feeling of emptiness.


---

@KapilGuptaMD How can one detach from the self in moments when pain shouts so loudly?

@russshanahan That is escapism.

It will not work.

@KapilGuptaMD Not as a means of escaping, but rather as a means of observing the moment without the experience being dominated by the senses. Do you think that observing the moment from the outside can work?

@russshanahan No.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do some memories keep playing? Is it an indication of lessons yet to be learnt from those incidents?

@VidhyaPal Mind thinks of nothing but the self

In past, present, and future.

@KapilGuptaMD Thank you. To understand further, then do these moments serve as better tools to understand the self? Because the association is strong?

@VidhyaPal No.

They are simply an empty habit of the mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD It seems everything is done to signal status, gain respect, or power. Is this motivation bad? If so how and with what do we replace it with?

@DogmaofNothing There is no bad or good.

What you describe is ego.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the most pernicious distraction from a sincere search for Truth?

@m_reviere Attachment to the world

And the self.

---

Be it self-realization or super-stardom,

All that is otherworldly

Arises from tragedy and suffering.

---

The Mysterious Machine:

To determine the Cause

That produces the Effect.

Having no interest in luck or good fortune

Determining first-hand, the inner workings of the Mysterious Machine

This cannot fail.

---

Tonight one is sitting in his home. Nothing special is happening. Sounds of dishes and voices. Thoughts of this and that running through the mind. Chores and minor anxieties racing through the veins.

Transformation begins Here.

---

If you have to chase it

You will never have it.

---

He who intricately aligns every facet of his life with Nature,

Has neither the use or the need

For meditation, spirituality, diet, or a “healthy lifestyle”

---

---

@KapilGuptaMD Upon coming to a genuine understanding that self, mind, thought, desire, etc. are purely circumstantial, what then, is the function of the mind in one’s search for Truth? Can it be useful? Or is it all noise to be ignored?

@The__Truth11 Mind becomes a tool

Once it is no longer one's ruler.

@KapilGuptaMD Can the same be said about domestic, worldly life? Namaste

@The__Truth11 It is all mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD If freedom is indifference to mind’s thoughts, then what guides action?

@VidhyaPal Thought guides action.

Action is impure.

Until it arises from non-self.

@KapilGuptaMD Thank you. Even when I am guided by the ethereal, my mind gets in the way of action sometimes. Transcending the fear of the mind in order to leap into the unknown becomes impossible at that time. Do you have any words to say on that?

@VidhyaPal Your reverence for "action"

Will lead you toward untruth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I always have a sense of fear inside me related to the uncertainty about next minute of my life. I feel like I'm not doing enough to live up to my potential this minute. How can I convert this fear to something which motivates me than otherwise?

@ALLOYMETALLIC If the fear is sufficiently deep

It will become its own motivation.

@KapilGuptaMD It's eating me from inside. Causing a lot of physical trauma. Should I lower my goals to get out of this ?

@ALLOYMETALLIC Run, and it will chase you.

Face it, and you will fail.

Ask what, then, to do,

And you will be seeking empty prescriptions.

---

@KapilGuptaMD is peace to be found within oneself through introspection or brought about in ones environment through action?

@JoeA414 Peace is the absence of thought.

If it is chased,

It is done out of pleasure.

Thus, never found.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Do you trust the ether completely? How do you know that it is not your mind playing a sophisticated game? Thanks

@VidhyaPal The mind is not That sophisticated

Provided one knows its ways.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What if anything allows you to see through statements made to you which are not sincere/ are not genuine?

@JLand568 Emotion

And the need to convince.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What occurs to a child during the transition from childhood to adulthood that strips him of his clarity and causes him to be enslaved to the mind?

@maydaytrade Societal associations.

---

@KapilGuptaMD When alone, I distract myself. Whether with work or indulgence, I feel compelled to do very different things compared to when other humans are around. I seem to have no will to stop these compulsions to pleasure. I am avoiding something. 

What am I not understanding?

@danomarr That you are where you are.

@KapilGuptaMD I am where I am. 
Thank you. 

And if I truly did not want to be where I am, I simply would not be there. Is this true?

As soon as I write this, it feels like I lost it. I had a visceral feeling in my stomach at first but then it left as soon as I tried to “catch” it. Why?

@danomarr Do not question it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is a way to distinguish between my ego is speaking or my true self is speaking?

@PlamenPetrov "True self" is concocted by the ego.

---


The thought of taking matters into one's own hands

Leads one to limitation and anxiety.

Things in life and nature

Happen of their own accord.

They are not the result of human effort and volition

As society has conditioned humans to believe,

But of a ripeness of conditions.

---


If one seeks to rise to the top of any field,

He will devote himself to convincing his heart and his mind

That the prevailing dogmas, methods, operations, and principles of that field

Are based entirely upon Untruth.

This is the doorway to the rarefied Pinnacle of any field.

---

Freedom

Is indifference to the mind's thoughts.

---

Man, in his conventional understanding of himself,

Is nothing.

His successes are not his.

His money does not truly belong to him.

His talents are not created by him.

All things are bestowed upon him by the Universe.

Through an unbroken chain

Of Cause and Effect.

---

Mind tells a man that he has improved. That he is more X and less Y than he used to be. It tells him that he needs to think this way and not that way. After all, the proper/good/right thing to do is X. Practice harder, get better, become more. Talking and talking and talking.

---

To like All

Creates no problems.

To dislike all

Creates no problems.

To like some

And dislike others

Creates a world of problems.

---

The true solution to any problem

Lies not in “solving” the problem,

But in Defining it.

---

Faced with stress,

The Mind moves moves in a consistent and predictable pattern for a given human being.

Once a human is made privy to his mind’s unique and particular pattern,

He is now able to exit the mind’s turmoil whenever he chooses.

“The reason that humans experience Anxiety

Is that the Mind literally manufactures it.

All anxiety-relief measures Excite the mind, by the very attempt to calm it. 

Causing the anxiety to establish permanent roots within the Mind”

- from Siddha Scrolls: Secrets Of The Mind

---

When one becomes perfectly certain

That there is nothing to be gained from anything or anyone in this world.

When this door, and all such possibilities, have been sealed shut,

Bliss overtakes a human being.

---

Uncompromise.

---

That which one refers to as Stability,

In the end,

Proves to be Imprisonment.

---

A person

Is nothing other than Mind, personified.

Happiness, unhappiness, pleasure, pain, like, dislike, being, non-being

Are but false notions it has come to imbibe.

It has no characteristics to improve,

None to shed.

It is a phantom,

Made flesh through misunderstanding.

"Confidence comes not through success, performance, results, or knowledge.

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Kapil, you talk about becoming a Legend and what one believes himself to be. How is this “image” different from the Manufactured Self product of societal conditioning?

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Kapil, you talk about becoming a Legend and what one believes himself to be. How is this “image” different from the Manufactured Self product of societal conditioning?

@Zoroaster88 Different levels.

Ultimate realization is no self.

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Another unrelated question.

Overall, whether in my craft or in life, I find it hard to “differentiate” between a pure and sincere action, and one influenced by my Mind / Ego. Is this something that naturally becomes clearer?

@Zoroaster88 The true motivation behind every action

Is readily available

If one truly desires to see it.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Does my ego exist because other people exist?

@1g1871 Your ego created yourself,

And the concept of "others"

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Good morning, Do our thoughts create us mentally and physically?

@FalconAndria The Mind has created what one has come to know as "oneself"

Thoughts arise from, and occur upon the substrate of, this self.

@KapilGuptaMDpvt If I may clarify, the actual pysical state of the body is also affected by thought?  Thank you.

@FalconAndria Thoughts produce activity of the endocrine system

Leading to physiologic changes in the body.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt In one podcast you said that humans fear success more than failure.
What is causing this?

@MatevzRopret A departure from the self-image that one has created for himself.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Why does exposure to Truth produce a cynical and depressive emptiness at times?

@RohanB00 "Cynical" is a societal judgment.

Truth may seem harsh,

Only because the false ideas that one has lived under for his entire life, are sweet and tasty lies.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I recognize that so much of what I do is not really done by me. I still desire to go someplace and do something. How could I approach that with honesty and truth?

@arete_light Truth is that all desires that are motivated by pleasure

End in hollow dissatisfaction

And create anxiety along the way.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Does one chose with his mind what to devote his life to?

@anzurav Moreso with his heart.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I want to move to another state. To be near where I grew up, went to@school, have friends and family and I like this particular area.  Is this me trying to seek pleasure and therefore not a wise decision?

@MaryDan34408598 It is you trying to seek pleasure.

But it matters not.

A genuine recognition that this is where you are,

Without trying to fight it or do otherwise,

Is Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt To chose where to go next with my life I've inspected my desires and almost all of them are socially programmed, fear based or is a result of basic physical cravings. Is there such thing as innate desire?

@anzurav There is a sense of a calling

Something that one finds oneself consistently returning to

---

To ordain as a monk, and live in a monastery is a theoretically fruitful proposition.

However, a mechanical performance of prescriptions and rituals do not create Transformation.

Alone with a Master

Or in Seclusion

Devoid of groups and prescriptions

Can Transform a human.

---

Teams at the highest level of sport, are coached with the lowest levels of understanding.

An understanding of the Mind, the source of performance, and the manner by which humans learn.

The One who understands this

Will be in the Rare position

To create an Unbeatable franchise

---

--- 

@KapilGuptaMD How do I accept a direction in life rather than fight it out of fear and uncertainty. 🙏🏽

@AmritYggdrasil Discover that which comes naturally

Without resistance.

---

@KapilGuptaMD You once said: “For a Mind becomes That,

To which it is most consistently exposed.”

Is what one consistently exposes his mind to determined by his DNA?

@themaxspence Whether it begins this way or not,

If one realizes this Truth,

They arrive in a unique position of control.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I know I’m supposed to be at the top.

Yet I constantly fall into the trap of worldly & carnal pleasures.

A rollercoaster of happy and sad without realisation.

What haven’t I understood?

@Ainsley79351582 That you are living according to should and should not

Rather than seriously examining the source of your compulsions.

@KapilGuptaMD The need for validation & a self image.
Where does it stem from?

@Ainsley79351582 Reinforcement of ego.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Pranaam 🙏 Is there any sense in marriage - the best form of which is companionship ? Can something external be on any value master ?

@MahimaT2017 An examination of the Need one is seeking to fulfill

And the attachments that result.

So long as this examination is one's constant companion,

He may do whatever he wishes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Do you believe in total forgiveness?

@SuzannaAloni I do not believe in belief.

Forgiveness is an act done in order to escape the discomfort of pain and conflict.

It is neither right nor wrong.

Examining the chase behind it

Is Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the understanding that allows one to grip routine lightly? No routine at all may not help. A rigid routine may become an empty prescription chase.

@arete_light Discover what it is one is trying to accomplish.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the best way to investigate and reach Truth?

I have always kept journals and diaries. I converted this habit into one where I write to deconstruct my thoughts and the so-called complexity of my life and problems. My instinct says it's working, but I'm wary...

@MoizRafay2 You are pursuing prescriptions.

Truth cannot be found through prescriptions.

---

Truth and mind at mutually exclusive 

---

@KapilGuptaMD I just read the bliss of distant shores and it excited me. The journey and the adventure of Shackleton. But I interpret some of your writings as a contrast— that nothing is worth pursuing. It’s all a waste of time, why? I live in conflict between the two paths. What am I missing

@MaryDan34408598 Nothing has significance.

Thus, the only thing one truly has is to be Lost in the art.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Dear Master, I have experienced that the mind is way too powerful to kick one back to not seeking truth. 
It can happen through unnatural events, coincidences or people. It’s unknown how this happens.
How to devote to seeking truth without alarming the mind?

@krtknowhere Truth is the arch enemy of the Mind.

What one naturally moves toward,

Is that which is most in his bones.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do we get angry?

@AkshadaDeo1 Because of desires, hopes, and expectations.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is your ultimate, unequivocal truth?

@AMeshkati There is Nothing.


---

@KapilGuptaMD Can you explain remaining uncompromising towards a vision and still maintain equanimity?  It seems to be uncompromising you have to judge between acceptable and unacceptable.    Thank you

@KevinHelix Attempts to maintain equanimity

Will sink you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Can you elaborate on the difference between a pleasure chase and a sincere journey?

@RohanB00 A pleasure seeks pleasure and happiness.

Sincerity seeks freedom from the need for pleasure and happiness.

---

@KapilGuptaMD A follow up question, if I may... 

How does one examine? How does one investigate for Truth?

@MoizRafay2 Whatever one is pursuing

In life

Or at a particular moment

Has a Truth.

Realizing this in one's bones

Is Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Do you believe in a higher power?

@gabeojeda There is a universal force

Best left nameless.

---

@KapilGuptaMD do you think a soul is important to focus energy on? things like theosophy and life after death. seems entirely like a fake idealism, but it seems like something you could believe in. It feels like it’s either the right direction or very much the wrong one. theosophy yes or no?

@SilenceOfTheDan One cannot focus upon

That which one does not for certain exists.

---

The man who sings with eyes closed

Walks aimlessly in the rain

Becomes the things that he sees

Oblivious to any and all,

Is no more.

Such a man has disappeared.

Truth is all that remains.

---

There is so much in this life to Realize.

So many powers to uncover.

So many Secrets to become privy to.

There is no happiness, glee, or spirituality to any such things.

Visceral, black and white Powers

That compose the substance of Man.

---

No significance

Spawns Freedom

From all limits.

---

When, after many years, a human being arrives at Seriousness and Sincerity,

His most thunderous realization is that there is no place in the world that he will find a path or people

That are Not mired in prescription and ritual,

Nor wholly devoted to Truth.

He is Alone.

---

May man take solace in the fact

That neither he or any other human is fit to judge him.

His intentions and actions, from the subtle to the gross,

Will be judged by the Universe itself.

It . . . Knows.

---

Let a man extricate himself from the ilk of the masses

Let him drop his unserious methods, austerities, and prescriptions

Let him end the procrastination to see what he was meant to See in this life

Innocent and inspired,

Let him turn his gaze in the direction of Truth.

---

A human, though he may be the richest in the land,

Lives, fundamentally, a life of chores.

A life of putting out fires

A life of running from This, and chasing after That.

A human, though he may be the richest in the land,

Is a Slave.

A Slave of the Mind.

---

A man is all that is pure

And all that is evil.

He carries within him the salt and the soil of all things.

Realizing this, he may come to see

That if he is all things,

He cannot be one thing.

And being not one thing,

He is No-Thing at all.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do we differentiate between effort that distracts and the honest search?

@2ndComingOfRoot By gauging one's level of genuine understanding about the consequences of prescriptions.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is guilt? Very interested in you thinking on guilt.

@ClifMilner A notion that one should have known better

When, in Truth, he did not.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How is passion different from attachment?

@pratikjkothari It depends upon context.

Beware of asking generalized and intellectual questions.

Be specific.

@KapilGuptaMD In your podcasts, you have explained the need to have passion and be in sincere to succeed but at the same time you have also explained the concept of being detached..how is this possible?

@pratikjkothari You are confused because you have prescriptionized my words

Rather than seeking Understanding.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I sometimes voluntarily put myself in a state of deep grief just by imagining horrible things for myself and others ( situations which may have never happened ) - why do I do this?  Thank you.

@notetwomyself Because it serves a need.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I still haven't found that one thing which I can devote my life to. I just don't feel strongly interested in anything, yet I am not happy with my life at the moment. Will exploring the many things that I am curious about help me find that one thing I can devote my life to?

@AbhilashNandan5 The craving to know this

Will keep you from it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is it so easy for me to get carried away when I'm with other people? It's like some spirit of the group takes hold of me and I act differently than usual.

@markojustmarko Desire for validation.

Thus, ego.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do we balance parental expectations alongside exploring our identity?

@SenseiRichiee Expectations are an attempt to reinforce or adorn identity.

@KapilGuptaMD Thank you for your answer. Am I right in thinking that the expectation from Person A towards Person B is how they view Person B’s identity? Compared to how Person B views their own identity

@SenseiRichiee It is how person A views his own identity.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Can Truth and success (in a monetary / career sense) be simultaneously pursued? Or does the devotion required to arrive in one prevent it in the other?

@teebesz Even monetary success has a Truth.

Truth excludes nothing.

It is the only thing that truly exists.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What’s the source of desire?

@rahulahuja It is a natural tendency of the Mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What does freedom mean to you?

@SeektheT Freedom is freedom from Mind

And

Freedom from Self.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to overcome analysis paralysis and be happy about my choices instead of feeling missing out on the opportunities provided by the doors I have closed?

@nitin_saxena_ There is no "happy about choices"

You only wish to stop paralysis, not the analysis.

---

@KapilGuptaMD It is clear that my "seeking" has become or is (and perhaps always has been) a default behaviour... is it True that this behaviour is an effect of something else... perhaps a mile wide insecurity or something deeper?  Is this pointing the directing of understanding vs the chase?

@michaeljbarry1 All humans are predisposed

To pleasure-chase.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I’m starting to see that pleasure is pain (It can’t be visceral as yet), but still seek pleasures such as food to get away from the uncomfortable feeling of unsatisfaction I’m getting. What am I not seeing, Master?

@TruthMerchantX That you are attempting to hasten the process

(For pleasure)

---

Transformation is genuinely available to a serious human being.

Beyond anything he thought possible

Beyond anything he has ever experienced.

Not in the fleeting sense of happiness or pleasure,

But in seeing things with a crystal clarity

Beyond explanation or words.

---

A man becomes Limitless

When his devotion to discovering The Truth is high

And his desire for the pleasure of results is low.

---

One must be willing to lose everything

In order to see the Hidden Truths in any thing.

Truth is for the man whose sights are set on Permanence

With an utter disregard for fleeting short-term pleasures.

---

A man who has been searching for peace all his life

Finds himself afloat beneath a capsized ship in the cold, dark Atlantic.

Upon discovering an air pocket,

He finds the peace he has been seeking.

Peace is found

In the geometric center

Of unending storms.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is truth? 

@ThomasHinds86 Everything has a Truth.

Practically, the genuine longing and devotion to discover Truth, rather than prescription

is Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Can desire compensate for lack of talent?

@im1303 Provided the desire is genuine and pure,

They are generally aligned.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Can a man find his own way or does he need a Master?

@maxaitken Each man ultimately finds his own way.

But he can only find it with a DNA, or an exposure to Truth.

There are perhaps a handful of people in the world who are not conditioned to seek prescriptions.

Through prescriptions, a man can never find the way.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do we keep seeking purpose in life?

@Amit17044 An attempt to fill the emptiness in one's heart.

---

@KapilGuptaMD You’ve said: “The human must not become adept at fixing and alleviating, and hoping over fearing. He must be trained to withstand all of these elements.”

What does this training look like?

@themaxspence Twitter cannot describe this.

It is a long and delicate journey into the void.

@KapilGuptaMD Is there another place where this journey is described?

@themaxspence It is a journey that one must go upon.

It cannot be window-shopped.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is trusting your gut/instinct something recommended?

@MofdiLombardi Instincts can guide a man.

Provided that the instincts have not been conditioned by prescriptions and the culture in which the man lives.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In my awareness, I'm aware of the self, the ego. My mind interprets this awareness as intelligence, then comes the feeling of guilt. I'm confused as to why I feel guilty for this.

@HeyObizzle It matters not

What emotions the mind creates.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is the feeling of guilt simply a byproduct of cultural conditioning?

@SlowwCo It is a lack of understanding

That one acts in accordance with his level of understanding.

---

@KapilGuptaMD The more I search for Truth, the more I feel like barely holding myself together. Processing what comes up is almost a full time job. 

Why am I feeling at the edge constantly? Does it ever go away?

@made_in_cosmos As long as it feels like a full time job

You are not yet ready for it.

When it is the only thing that exists

You will not feel troubled by the fact that it is full time

Or that it is a job.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Do I have to pursue art, skill, business or sports be a master? I just want to be a master of my mind.

@TshepoMosella A master of the Mind

Is a Master of all of those things.

---

Freedom lies not in feeling free

It lies in the genuine indifference to how one feels.

---

Let it be known

That be it a person or a thing

The more you care

The more you need,

The greater your Attachment

And the greater will be your Suffering.

---

Human beings approach ethereal states such as No-Mind

Through the vehicle of fMRI, EEG, data points, conferences, and science.

Nature does not allow its most rarefied elixirs to be captured in test tubes.

In order to own it

One must prove himself worthy to receive it.

---

He who likes nothing

Dislikes nothing

Hopes for nothing

Laments nothing

Accepts nothing

Rejects nothing

Is the man who walks through walls

And passes easily through all of life's storms.

Wherever he may go in this world

His mind remains clear

His heart remains free.

---

The attachments forged yesterday

The needs created today

Will bring you to your knees tomorrow.

---

Rain can only soak one who is dry

Pain can only hurt one who craves pleasure

Turmoil can only affect one who craves peace

Conflict can only harm one who craves harmony

Mud can only soil one who is clean.

The one who craves Nothing

Can be harmed by Nothing.

---

---

Kind, lazy, mean, courageous, cowardly, moral, strong, resilient, intelligent . . .

Are labels nowhere to be found in the domain of Truth.

A human thinks and feels many things,

Thus, acts in many ways.

Thought, feeling, and action

Moreso happen To Him

Than arise From Him.

---

Expectation

Spawns comparison.

Comparison

Spawns anxiety.

Anxiety

Spawns a chase.

A chase

Spawns more chases.

---

Questions Tonight:

The Serious Man recognizes

That his time on this earth has almost come due

He has not an hour to waste on the games of the Mind.

You may ask

If you wish

Namaste.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the most dangerous game of the Mind?

@scookhq The most dangerous game

Is to entertain the games of the Mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is worth doing or pursuing?

@rahulahuja Arriving at Freedom from the Self.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you let go of the judgment of others, when they are close in your life?

@Mar_Vel_ By coming to the realization

That man has not the 360 degree to understanding

To see the entire situation.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you overcome adversity and accomplish your goals?

@gabeojeda A requisite desire

Carries a requisite result.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the single biggest decision that can change ones life for good ?

@NitinSaini298 The understanding that man does not truly decide.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What questions are useful to identify the truth about your industry or the game within the game?

@ndsa1208 What precisely you are seeking.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Where is the Truth ?

@ekastelano In the purity of the devotion to discover it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD is it possible to work almost every hour on the task or goal? There is a saying that mind [efficiently works only for 4-5 hours a day? How do I increase my capacity to work maximum? After some time I find my mind isn't just supporting, ]()however hard I try.

@raushan2020 It is not about "work"

It is about Engagement.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What attaches the mind to the concept of time?

@angelvalue Thought.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is preventing me from achieving consistency in my performance results? A good performance has not lasted, it has always been followed a poor one

@e825e57e60fe409 If performance is a goal

It becomes a fruitless chase.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to get Visceral understanding. Does it start in the mind?  - please reply master

@JS42215436 Truth lies outside the Mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD My actions write my future or is it already written?

@akiranakamoto It matters not.

The present determines the future.

@KapilGuptaMD Thank you. Do my past lives determine my present?

@akiranakamoto It would be wiser to focus upon your Today

Determining your Tomorrow.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is life just about experiencing the moment?

@MikeDavis_44 Chasing experiences

Is chasing pleasures.

Chases

Have nothing to do with life.

---

@KapilGuptaMD You sometimes speak throughout your writings of concepts such as karma, reincarnation, samskaras, or the nameless force behind the Universe affecting us all. Are these beliefs, metaphors, or do you know them to be Truth?

@teebesz I have never spoken of such things in definite terms.

@KapilGuptaMD Are they topics that are worth spending time understanding, or would they further confuse a search for Truth?

@teebesz What is here and now

And most acute in one's life

Is his path.

@KapilGuptaMD Thank you for your time, here and now

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to overcome the fear of losing your loved ones?

@Yogita92167985 There is no "doing"

That causes one to overcome anything.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Kapil, I recognize certain behaviors & conditioning but only intellectually. I feel there’s a lot of inertia; I also feel that a lack of pain keeps me in a comfort zone. How can I get closer to Truth when there is apparently no pain or acuteness in certain aspects of one’s life?

@Zoroaster88 The desire to be

Where one is not

Is a Truth in itself.

Truth lies in living within What Is.

---

The Truth is that a man is going to die. As he sleeps in the night. As he moves through is daily routines. As he plans for the future. Death is moving toward him at lightning speed.

Whether all is well, or unwell,

All that he truly has

Are these moments

Before his death.

---

Nature fails not to thwart

Any and all things

Done for the purposes of validation or praise.

The uncompromising purity of one's pursuits

Are the only thing a man will ever have.

---

Living homeless

In the wind and the cold

On pavement rough and firm

Is certainly not easy.

But it just might be easier

Than living a life

Doing what one does not like, worrying about money, living in conflicting relationships, in a monotonous domesticity.

---

Every human being lives forever upon an invisible cusp.

He lives inches away from learning a Truth

That will in that very instant

Transform his life

Alter his life trajectory

And consume him with inspiration and direction.

---

Siddha Secret: Ultimate Performance

Performance is a side effect.

Pursued as a goal, it vanishes.

---

In this life,

Nothing truly belongs to a man.

Not his family or children

Not his money or land

Not the clothes on his back

Or the sandals on his feet.

All is on loan by grace of the Universe.

A gateway to Freedom . . .

---

A Man Of Truth

Must first understand his nature.

Then, rise above it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I know we must work so that our work is what gives us joy, this as opposed to just “making a living”. 

Is the key finding a way to survive off it no matter what, because to have a passionless job is to squander the possibility for joy?

@2ndComingOfRoot There is no right and wrong.

There is no rule that one must have passion.

Or that one cannot work at an unfulfilling job.

To view it this way is to miss the point.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is Seriousness and Sincerity mutually exclusive? If so, why?

@jamesqn_ They are the same.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Desired Items or opportunities (chases) have a tendency to present themselves when one no longer feels the attachment or need for them. Why might this be? What truth do I not yet see 
@JoshOlfert Things, and people, run when chased.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Kapil, what is the Truth about envy / jealousy?

From where does it arise?

What can be said about one’s level of understanding if such a feeling arises?

@Zoroaster88 Self-image

Ego.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Kapil, I truly desire to maximize my potential

What question might I ask myself to root out behaviours that compromise my Journey?

@journeyofone1 What is that I genuinely want.

Is the answer that I receive a chase for pleasure

Or a chase for the Thing itself.

---

Throughout much of a man's life, he is trapped in the illusions of interpersonal relations.

If clarity dawns, he comes to the realization that the person whom he has been chasing and running from all along, is also the only one he must ever learn to live with:

Himself.

---

The man who by no choice of his own

Is driven to become a Legend.

Will likely not have been given the DNA

Or the availability in spirit and constitution

For perfecting the delicate mathematics of human relationships.

---

A man may, if he so wishes, spend his life searching for Answers.

Truth lives in Questions.

---



@KapilGuptaMD Why does the Mind wish for things to be different than the way they are, nearly every moment of one’s life? Where does this stem from?

@The__Truth11 An addiction to pleasure.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Which are the main questions of life?

@ArashGilan It depends what one is genuinely seeking.

@KapilGuptaMD My quest is the journey itself not the answers are the “right” things. What are the most important questions you ask if I may ask?

@ArashGilan What is it that I do not know.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In a state of peace, if one isn't motivated by the desire for pleasure what serves the impetus for action? Thank You!@HackHourHQ A human is always motivated by a desire for pleasure.

Until he recognizes the fruitlessness of such a chase.

After one arrives viscerally at such a realization,

Motivations arise to do that which is inevitable.

---

@KapilGuptaMD There was a moment when my entire self fell apart. When I had seen consciousness for what it is. Now I am questioning everything that arises. Please help me understand, is involuntary thought the same as voluntary thought? I no longer know what to trust.

@AranPourawal All thought is noise.

@KapilGuptaMD Can any of the noise be true? Can one use this noise to their advantage? For example asking a question that arises through the noise, is that question worth paying mind to?@AranPourawal You would like it to be true.

You are not yet ready for the Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do we, or I, always think what could go wrong instead of what could go right?

@MattWPhotograph This is not your problem.

Your problem lies in the fact that you believe in the concept of "right and wrong."

---

@KapilGuptaMD Can anyone outside of one’s self guide one to Truth?

@smallstockfocus Loosely and delicately.

But you will not a find a single person in this world who will not prescribe to you.

Therefore, practically speaking, no.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What does it mean when nothing matters?

@Im_iyare All things have no true significance.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Understanding that what a man chases runs from him..

What does a man do with his time when he does not know what he wants to do with his life?

@_damarioj One may wish to examine his chases.

Allowing himself the possibility to not waste the time that he has,

Whatever he may or may not do with it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I struggle to understand why pursuing freedom from the self is a worthy expenditure of time. I believe you when you say it is, but I also know that belief does not belong anywhere on this Journey.

If all is meaningless, why is any pursuit more or less worthy than another?

@teebesz The Ultimate Pursuit

Is the one that swallows whole, the "pursuer."

---

@KapilGuptaMD If the ultimate Truth is there is nothing, then what is immersion in one’s craft?

@themaxspence Disappearance of the self.

Into Nothingness.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Dear sir, I am not sure if this qualifies as a valid question but i want to understand about the chakras and how they really affect us. Any guidance or thoughts on that, please ? :)

@vish9009 There are Truths with regard to the internal systems and alchemy of the human body.

In the realm of meridians/prana/qi/chakras . . .

Viewing through the lens that they are presented in the world, will not lead you to The Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In a life where nothing truly matters, how is it possible to have motivation to pursue anything?

@launganik Significance has nothing to do with Pursuit.

One can only achieve the height of heights

Precisely when there is no significance

And no real consequences.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is all thinking about the Truth empty intellectualization?

@RohanB00 Yes.

But you will view this as a prescription,

So no response will help you.

You will have to Understand.

@KapilGuptaMD I admit, I do not understand and feel lost
Thank you

@RohanB00 All things have a Truth.

Whatever in your life is troubling you

Whatever in your life you are pursuing,

Has a cause

It has a Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Of the small handful of masters in which you have engaged with, what in them stands above all others you have come by in your life?

@nourbeam I have not personally, and in real life, engaged with any masters.

---

Truth lives in the domain of No Thought.

In this domain,

A human becomes a Being.

He rises above all things.

Most of all,

The wholly limited, struggling, and groping patchwork of a creature

He has come to know as . . . himself.

---

Humans attach to other humans

As a way to further attach to their own identities.

The greatest human Freedom

Is the freedom from all things

And from all people.

Which, at its very essence,

Is the Freedom from one's own identity.

---

# Snippets - Temp

---

Life provides sunshine and storms

Truth lies in being indifferent to both.

---

When a man is young, he tries to please his parents

When he gets married, he tries to please his spouse

When he becomes a father, he tries to please his children

When he grows old, he tries to please god.

One day, he comes to discover

That his life has never been his own.

---

As you stand at the precipice of this life,

Understand this before entering:

Set your eyes upon the mystery of nature and its beings,

And you will reap an unimaginable reward.

Set your heart upon them,

And you will pay an unfathomable price.

Smartphone addicts

Do not become Legends.

If Tiger Woods was raised in the era of smartphones

The world would never have heard of him.

---

A man spends 84 years in wait

For moments that total 37 hours in happiness, reward, vindication, acknowledgment, and pleasure.

---

No one thinks about you in quite the way you think

No one will love you in the way that you hope

No one can give you what you have always longed for

No one will make you what you seek to become.

To Lean

Is to Fall.

---

The Moment

Is man’s only true refuge

From chaos and sorrow.

---

There are things that you do not know

Which if you came to know them

Would categorically transform your earthly existence.

---

Man becomes so preoccupied with his problems, that he can no longer live without them.

If he is not finding a solution to his problem, he feels something is amiss.

When problems become a man's friend

And searching for solutions becomes his friend

He lives as his own enemy.

---

If you are respected or not

If fortune has given to you or has not

If life is painful or not,

It is neither good or bad.

There is no one to forgive

And nothing to fix.

Raw Truth is the only thing there is.

There is nothing to say about it,

Nothing to think about it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, I am conflicted. I seek to live outside the Mind, but some level of human relationships appear to be a necessity. And human relationships appear to require Mind by default. 

Do you have any words on this?

@The__Truth11 It will not help you to view human relationships as a thing you must rid yourself of.

This is what is standing in your way at this juncture.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What does it mean to conquer the mind? What does a conquered mind feel like?

@deeptanshuMalik A conquered mind is one that does not speak until given the permission to do so.

---

@KapilGuptaMD If children have no mind naturally. Why can't they produce great art. Is the place beyond the mind assessible only after one matures? Or is it the maturity of the intellect that is required.

@Alishah28507093 Anyone can produce great art at any age.

As a human grows, his intellect grows.

As his intellect grows, the less art he is capable of producing.

---

@KapilGuptaMD i have issues with physical health issues that i can’t resolve and i want to know how to improve my physical health and diet but i don’t know the truth about food or exercise and get lost in where to look

@SilenceOfTheDan Not knowing where to look in a society filled with lies

Is a universal problem, in all topics and disciplines.

Experimentation is paramount.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What characteristics separate a Genuine Desire from a pursuit of pleasure?

@The__Truth11 You are best to assume that they are all pleasures.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, what makes a great student?

@OpenAleph One who has seen the catastrophic consequences of prescriptions.

One who seeks The Truth.

@KapilGuptaMD And what makes a great teacher?

@OpenAleph One who does not prescribe.

---

@KapilGuptaMD When examining the truth, I have a tendency to then start viewing things as right and wrong. 

Do you have any words on this?

@David__Garner So long as the concept of right and wrong hold sway

One can never have the eyes for Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD how to deal with self-sabotage?

@HR_Castillo "Dealing with" anything is a waste of time.

Empty, frivolous self-help concept.

@KapilGuptaMD I see. Then, how can I train the mind to stop self-sabotage behavior? Should I look for the roots?

@HR_Castillo Yes.

Self-sabotage is not a behavior.

It is a reaction to something.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, is it true when one is sincere nature talks back and conveys the truth?

@aesthete Where there is Sincerity,

A way will present itself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sir everyday i awake in the morning only with one thought of leaving my job ? I don't know why. But my circumstances are such that i m not in a position to leave it.

@ANayyar16 Then that is the Truth.

@KapilGuptaMD Truth of my circumstances ?

@ANayyar16 Yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the best approach to stop drinking? Thank you

@wilchong1 It is about what sort of one person one believes oneself to be.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What does it really take to Arrive? Is there a possibility of getting lost along the way?

@Njmav Seriousness.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Advice on what to do with anger in your heart after someone wrongs you? Pls don’t say let it go 🙏🏼

@zar__tan The Truth is that one must first learn to move beyond good, bad, right, and wrong.

For these will be his greatest impediment to seeing The Truth.

One may act in any way that he likes,

So long as that action that he chooses

Does not excite his Mind.

---

Man craves validation from the world,

The adoration of his children

And for things to be the way he hoped, or the way they once were.

Even if he had them, they would not satisfy him.

All cravings lead to nothing.

For Nothing

Is all a man will ever truly have.

---

All that excites a man

Loses its shine.

All that pains him

Loses its grip.

All things arise from insignificance.

And to insignificance they return.

---

Society has sold you the greatest of lies

That the goal of life is to become “happy.”

This one chase

Has cost you your life.

---

All the happiness in the world

All the good fortune on earth

Compares not

To a Mind that has come upon silence.

---

What could a human being achieve

If he was not addicted to smart phones

Was not societally conditioned to socialize

And did not allow any form of interference in his daily existence.

Pursuing this Question

Would not be a wasted life.

--- 

In your life, you have carried out shades of good

And shades of evil.

Paying a price untold for both.

Though you may spend every single moment, from this day to that,

You will never satiate the Mind's interrogations.

For the Mind has not the capacity

To make you whole.

---

From the perspective of the Mind,

Every life is a difficult life.

From the perspective of Truth,

There is no chronological "life" at all.

---

Siddha Secret: Clarity vs Doubt

If one is driven by the hope of reward

And the pleasure of favorable outcomes,

He will be stricken by self-doubt.

If he is at all times self-honest about the purity of his motivations,

His decisions and his actions will arise from Clarity.

---

As a man awakens from slumber,

Let him not assess the state of his life.

Let his mind drift neither toward his good fortunes nor his grievances.

His true existence lies in the single breath, the single step.

His freedom lies beyond the saga and the story

Known as “his life.”

---

What is

Is.

It is not wise to impress this upon yourself.

But simply to let it go where it goes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is there something spiritually special about humans? ( vs other living creatures )

@notetwomyself The ability to have insight about the true nature of their condition.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it any use keeping records of your prior performance when trying to improve? Like reruns of past plays on videos, or even watching videos of others play, sing, dance?

@Alishah28507093 Form is a result of something more fundamental.

It is not a thing to be mimicked.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sometimes for a few minutes after I awake my mind is perfectly still. I often have profound insights into investment decisions and other things at these moments. 

I ask for your insight into this so I can find a way to live in this state.

@iworeahoodie Chasing the state

Is a pleasure chase.

Thus, one moves further from it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Every joyous moment of my life feels a little empty and meaningless unless, I share it with others (mostly loved ones). What is the truth behind the act of sharing?

@notetwomyself It matters not.

You are compelled to share it with others. 

Any Truth that is "shared" with you about this,

Will not change that compulsion.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What prevents one's drive from lining up with one's deepest calling?

@teebesz Viewing things from the standpoint of a "calling," can lead one astray.

What one is most driven to do is acute and practical.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it true that the "thinker" is also a thought?

@AG5thankunext The concept of a thinker . . .

Yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Over the years certain circumstances have caused me to develop extreme social anxiety, and it has ruined my life. Is there a way out?

@tymbaltactics It could be a blessing.

Socialization is one of the most common ways in a which a human wastes his life.

---

@KapilGuptaMD are emotions like love, romantic interest with opposite sex is the hindrance on the path of becoming legend?

@raushan2020 It matters not.

What one is most compelled to do, he will do.

Hindrance or not.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is it that the self image is valued so highly above everything else?

@themaxspence For a given man,

There is nothing else.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What would you say to adult who is depressed because he is Completely periled by all the failures and doesn’t see light at the end of the tunnel.

@mnishshetty1 The longing to free oneself from depression

Will exacerbate his depression.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have the desire to find the truth about certain aspects of my life. The right path is what troubles me.

@Queen_amiirah There is no right path.

The more genuine the desire,

The more naturally the path will unfold.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to separate fact from opinion when seeking truth?

@thunderbythesea By genuinely assessing the purity of one's pursuit.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one deal with the constant fear of being judged, of always wanting to prove(please) at work. This all originated from a sense of low self worth, which makes one vulnerable to being judged( or suppressed) in the first place. How does one tackle that ?

@OnceUponARohan Where there is a balloon of self-image,

Someone will most certainly stick a pin in it.

---

In searching for what he does not have,

Man sacrifices what he does have.

In examining what he has,

He looks in the direction of people and things.

And in doing so fails to see

Who he is without them.

---

No matter how bright the sparkle,

All things in this life eventually lose their shine.

---

Relationships,

Be they between wood and steel in a building

Or between human beings in society,

Begin to fail,

When one object/human places an undue need or demand upon another.

Truth lies in carrying the weight of one’s life

Upon his own shoulders.

---

If a man needs no one to like him, agree with him, praise him, validate him, forgive him, acknowledge him, invite him, or accept him,

If he is indifferent to the winds of circumstance

And to the hand of fortune . . .

Such a man floats through life,

Free of all burdens.

---

The greatest temptation of a leader or a parent

Proves also to be his costliest mistake:

To say or to do a thing

Simply because he can.
