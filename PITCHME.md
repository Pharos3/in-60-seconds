Nether the devil

Nor the people of the world

Nor the wrath of nature itself . . .

Can lay a finger upon the man,

Who needs nothing from anyone.

Not even himself.

---

What imprisons a man most

Is not the reliability of the "bad"

But the possibility of the "good."

---

If I cannot have it Forever

I do not want it for a single Moment.

---

None of society’s tenets are Truths**.

**What is the proof for this?**

**The proof is that these tenets cannot stand alone.**

**Each tenet requires its counterpart.**

**A fix cannot survive without the problem it is trying to mend.**

**If the problem dies, the fix dies as well.**

**That which cannot stand on its own two feet, unreliant upon any element or authority, is Untruth.**

**Truth needs no support**.

---

A Master is always the same

Without trying to be.

For he has seen The Truth behind all things

And thus, does not succumb to the chase for happiness or pleasure.

---

M: **That when a man understands that he is nothing, he no longer has any need to enforce his will upon anyone or anything. He becomes like a willow. The world and its people can bend him, but he will never break.**

S: How is it that you arrived at such a state, Master. How did you become a willow?

M: Such unfathomable things do not happen by choice, student. One arrives at them when it is an inevitability.

S: It became inevitable for you, Master?

M: Yes.

S: In what way?

M: **I learned that everything in life turned out to be a dead end. Even the most promising of things. There was destitution at every turn. Things certainly went up, but when they came down they crashed into one million pieces. All “bad’s” were far more bad than the “good’s” were good. This led to seeing through the idea of good and bad

x

You will not have to make yourself. Life will make you. If you have the wisdom to see and to hear.**

**When you see that the good’s are not so good. And the bad’s are not so bad. You will lose interest in both. The day that you lose interest, you will have arrived at The Truth. From that day forward, you may bend in all glorious directions. But never will you break

---

It is wise to incessantly examine and observe in search of The Truth.

But any firm "conclusion" that one makes from his observations

Will be incomplete and premature.

---

He who harbors no demands

Attracts no problems.

---

No one in your life will understand you

The ones who say they do are doing their best to “compassionately pretend.”

---

@KapilGuptaMD When so many things in life is determined by your place of birth and events happening in life, how much free will an individual has!??

@swetshah The question is not one of free will

For the depth of a given desire trumps any and all circumstances.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I had an insight the other day, in which I saw the lack of a self with perfect clarity. Now I no longer have that clarity—I only remember it. For this realization to become permanent, must I arrive at it repeatedly?

@jimmpierce The only things that remain Permanent

Are those that are side effects of Realization.

The things that are fleeting

Are those that are sought after in the form of "an experience."

---

@KapilGuptaMD why a human keep repeating what doesn't work even though his daily life depend on memory ? 

why he forgets that the thing didnt work out last time he tried it in that way ?
when does one sees that budhi is stronger ?

@rohantw Human beings do not function by way of logic.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In what ways does right questions create a path?.. What quality  one needs to  sense the path being created?

@muthunagarajan1 The perfect Question stirs investigation

"Answers" lead to a prescription chase.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How to observe thoughts?

@ajiteshc27 There is no point.

---

@KapilGuptaMD With all sincerity, do friends have any role in your life?

@cyborean My life is devoted to seeking Truth

A rather unpopular and anti-social pursuit.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What does it take to reach max possible happiness level?

@KushalTweets991 Max possible suffering

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you live your life knowing that it will come to an end one day?

@i_Wein It is only Then that one is able to truly Live.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I struggle with approval seeking. What is the truth behind this flaw outside of seeing the world through an attachment to the self?

@ndsa1208 The only flaw
Is attempting to be rid of it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is memory?

@TheTemp10 A burden.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What question do you wish you were asked more often?

@russshanahan There are few individuals that seem to consistently ask quality questions

Their questions demonstrate a significant degree of self-examination

They do not ask flippantly or curiously or intellectually

It reflects a unique inner DNA.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is the conquering of the mind similar to conquering an opponent on the battlefield. Or is it a never ending battle where the mind constantly resurfaces?

@Sharan_Piave It is not a fight

It is a quiet understanding.

---

@KapilGuptaMD what must one see to stop identifying with thought?

@minecraftscum That virtually all thoughts are lies.

---

M: **There is no right or wrong, student. There is only cause and effect**.

S: Might you expand a little, Master?

M: **There is nothing wrong with victories, rewards, or ambitions. The question is what effect they have upon a human being.**

S: And what effect is that?

M: **Where there is a reward on the horizon, there will be an effect upon the human mind. The effect will result in a chase.**

S: If I may ask, what is wrong with a chase?

M: **It would be more effective to ask what the Effect of a chase is.**

S: And what is that?

M: **The effect of a chase is anxiety. A man who chases will live under the weight of hope, fear, and anxiety. Any thought or action that arises from hope, fear, or anxiety is a reactive thought or action. Any thought or action that is reactive is not Truth. Thus it is bound to create more problems in its wake.**

This is a path that can never lead to permanence, peace, mastery, or one's true potential. This is a path that cannot lead to an Arrival.

---

There is nothing wrong or improper about playing the silly little games you play with yourself

There is nothing bad about living a lie

The problems begin

When you think you shouldn’t be.

---

A prayer for the Ignorant:

Dear god, please bless me. And give me this and that.

A prayer for the Wise:

Dear Universe, allow me to see with crystal clarity how Hope sets me up for an inevitable fall.

And allow me to see the monumental cost of living a life of Need.

---


The problem with Reward

Is that it feels good.

The problem with feeling good

Is that it is pleasurable.

The problem with pleasure

Is that man enjoys it beyond compare.

Thus, such a one is chained to hankering for a reward

And, therefore, he is doomed to a life of anxiety.

---

It is 100 times easier to accept that one is “doing it wrong”

Than it is to believe that the concept is a lie.

The spiritual and performance community knows this

It is their ace in the hole.

---

Information is imperfect to entirely false

If it arises from the impurity of personal motive.

Scientific papers are motivated by “publish or perish”

Magazines are motivated by sensationalism and sales

Truth has little market value

But massive value for the one who learns it.

---

What is the Meaning Of Life?

Life is not a puzzle to be solved

It is an essence to be Accessed.

It is accessible by the One

Who arrives at the realization

That the person who is asking this question

Does not, in truth, exist.

---

All anger directed at oneself

Is mock outrage.

---

Among the most sincere and effective actions

Is to put on a clean white shirt and pressed pants,

Draw the curtains and turn off the phone,

Sit on the floor in the corner of a dark and quiet room,

And ask oneself,

“What is it that I Really Want?”

---

The selfish recluse obsessed with achieving self realization

Benefits the world infinitely more

Than the “selfless” philanthropist obsessed with charitable deeds.

---

Among the greatest of all Superpowers

Is the immunity to Pleasure.

---

A Herculean Power

A Transformative human milestone:

Arriving at the place

In which one no longer has to answer to their Mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why attachments are so attractive and interesting, apart from destructive ?

@ZobairSiddique Because they provide the opportunity for pleasure.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you find balance financially and spirituality? Meaning that most need to work to survive and being present at work is often difficult.

@VernonHeater Spirituality is a dead-end

Balance is a dead-end

Trying to be present is a dead-end

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is focusing on solving multiple problems at a time effective? Also, where would the paralysis from feeling overwhelmed come from?

@theodore_nit Problems are not cured by being "solved"

They are cured by being Seen.

---

@KapilGuptaMD When my utmost desires are about to be fulfilled, i suddenly quit ... to regret later. Why ?

@ZobairSiddique You did not really want them.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Do words weaken the truth?

@Feezy_F Yes.

But a boat is needed to cross the river, before it can be abandoned.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have battled with anxiety for a while now, and everything I've tried has been a series of temporary fixes. What do you suggest I do to end this suffering?

@AbstractOnion Explore the nature of the suffering

Without any attempt to end it.

@KapilGuptaMD To what end, then?

@AbstractOnion Transformation lies in the Seeing

Not in the fixing.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I want to just be, but my mind wanders. How can I train my mind to be still?

@not_Mehdi By understanding that wanting to "just be" is yet another form of Unstillness.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why we all running? and the destination really exists?

@imragupathi The Mind is a desiring machine.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Do the fantasies that my mind constantly revisits have any resemblance to what I truly desire?

@NethersTheorem You do not truly desire anything.

@KapilGuptaMD Am I mistaken in thinking that the impetus that drives an athlete/artist/CEO is a deep-seated desire or vision?

@NethersTheorem It is always a desire

It may or may not be a vision.

@KapilGuptaMD What makes you say I do not truly desire anything?

@NethersTheorem It is the Mind that desires.

@KapilGuptaMD Does acting on the desire of the mind come at a cost? Is it just another empty chase?

@NethersTheorem Yes.

But this will not have the power to stop you from doing it.

@KapilGuptaMD Then what is the impetus of pure, innocent engagement in a craft? 

That is what I miss about being a kid. Zero consideration of other people’s opinions, zero anxiety about outcomes.

@NethersTheorem Too much want and chase

A total refusal to see where you Are.

@KapilGuptaMD Thank you for answering my questions.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the difference between Feeling and The Truth? I’m reading one of your books now and it seems you feel feeling = truth. But I assume it’s not a direct 1:1, would love your thoughts

@GrantDuckworth Feeling is closer to Truth than thought

But it is not Truth itself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How did you learn to ask great questions to yourself to gain understand of what you want to know the truth about? I feel like I need to ask myself better questions, but I don’t necessarily know how to come to those questions.

@arnej247365 A burgeoning disinterest in the status quo

A burgeoning desire to truly Know.

@KapilGuptaMD In a podcast you said one of your favorite questions is “what is right in front of me that I am just not seeing.” What is another question you ask yourself a lot?

@arnej247365 This Question is one that is enough to last a lifetime.

@KapilGuptaMD I love that question. Ever since I heard you say that I use it all the time. Thank you.

@arnej247365 Be careful about "using it."

@KapilGuptaMD Yeah it doesn’t work all the time. It’s not a fail safe, I don’t know what it is, must be intuition and sincerity, but there is something about that question that is different.

---

If a man discovers Truth

In any form

In any domain,

He must realize that any discussions about it

Will only serve to separate him from it.

The world will not understand.

The man of Truth must walk alone.

---

Learn from the stillness of Trees

Learn from the grace of the gliding Cloud

Learn from the freedom of the flowing Stream

Learn from the naturalness of a bird in flight.

Nature has settled into an Arrival.

He who abandons all his chases

Does precisely the same.

---

The things that we understand, create Silence

The things that we do not, create Emotion.

---

A gentleman I just met passionately urged me to help the world and improve generations

It is natural to believe that if humans are “helped,” they transform.

The Truth is, rare is the human who seeks to be separated from the comfort and familiarity of his illusions.

---

No human in the history of the world

Has ever failed because they did not have the necessary “know-how”

Or because they lacked sufficient luck or opportunity.

They failed because they did not have the Requisite Desire.

---

The end of Involuntary Thought

Is Everything.

It is the Truth that summarizes all Truths.

But rare is the man who is ready for the fantastical thoughts and dreams of his life

To come to an end.

For this would create

And end to his own existence.

---

Wherever a man sees a train of Pleasure,

He buys a ticket and hops aboard.

These trains have numerous convenient pick-up locations

But they all go to the same destination:

The edge of a cliff.

---

It is a transformative milestone in a human being’s life

When he no longer looks forward to anything

Nor succumbs to despair.

When the things that once excited or disappointed him

Have lost their power over him.

When bright colors

Fade into pale pastels.

---

The Master observes.

Not for practice or austerity

Nor for improvement or “spirituality.”

He observes in order to see with total clarity,

The futility of it all.

---

What is a human being’s greatest burden?

A desire for that which he currently does not possess

And cannot guarantee to possess in the near future.

---

The man who, by any possible means, arrives at a place of:

“I am unconcerned with the way that I feel. Be it high or low, pleasant or unpleasant. For I have learned that such feelings are whims of a wayward mind, beyond my control”

Is a man who can never be touched by anxiety.

---

What is a human being’s greatest fear?

Feeling in a way he does not wish to feel.

---

The Vision must be created with delicate and painstaking precision

It is only then that one is in a position to ruthlessly eliminate anything and everything that does not move one toward it.

---

"When the good’s no longer shine bright

And the bad’s no longer create concern

Something fundamental changes within a man

He becomes Available to Truth.

He now possesses the time and space to see what he has never before seen"

- The Purity Of Action

(A Private Discourse)

---

It is never about “working”

It is all about The Work.

The glory lies in the Creation

The bliss lies in the Engagement.

For after all the riches have been amassed

And the applause has faded into oblivion

The Purity of the creation

Is all a man truly has.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Does one need to eliminate the ego or learn from it.

@JinKwon Neither.

---

@KapilGuptaMD how to do work while staying in a state of detachment?

@Anejagaurav Detachment cannot be an ideal to live up to

Ideals go nowhere.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is there any work that is true, or leads me to the truth?

@moyinho20 The work that you cannot live without.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is ignorance bliss for human?

@sanoc720 Ignorance is expensive.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is it that I am tortured by a need to feel validated by my parents. What is it that I have not seen?

@CanteneW They will be serious about you

When you are serious about yourself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Last time I asked a question about desire/vision and you told me that “you do not truly desire anything,” that it is the mind that desires.

What then is the utility in asking oneself, “What do I truly desire?” Or in creating a precise vision regarding what one wants to achieve?

@NethersTheorem Man desires losing himself

Find the thing which you can lose yourself in.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, why do i become lenient to people whose chains are tied to my feet? And not become insolent enough to break them to find other ways of freedom ?

@ZobairSiddique There is something you gain from doing so.

---

@KapilGuptaMD A part of me relys on the love of others, yet the love is always hollow, how do i move into a way that is greater than attatchment to love?

@werdnawod Experience and observe the consequences of attachment.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one achieve true peacefulness?

@gabeojeda Liberation from the self.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What makes one pursue truth?

@ananthrk It is unique to a given person.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Hi Kapil , for given task in hand instead of starting it mind always gives options to avoid task , what is truth here , why mind behaves like that

@_ravi You are not truly interested in the task

---

@KapilGuptaMD If an opinion is a personal belief then why do we get offended when we hear others opinions on a subject?

@11ho_oh11 It changes your opinion about yourself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How can I stay longer in the place between what I see and What I feel?

@ImmortalMortal0 If you truly See

You care not how you feel.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one differentiate between "instinct" and "mind"? 

Thank you

@ndsa1208 It is all mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How do you discover what you need to be focus on?

Being one that has a varying interest.

@real_DavidALADE There are interests

And there are obsessions.

---

If a man exposes his Mind solely to the things he wants it to imbibe,

If he engineers his every action in order to allow his Mind to record only the things he wants it to play back to him,

He will have created his interior Environment precisely to his specifications.

---

A Question for he who seeks a Life Of Satisfaction:

What is that Truth

That upon having seen it,

The desiring machine that is the Mind

Will come to an immediate halt.

---

Few men come to realize

That their entire life

Has been lived inside their Mind.

---

Every fortuitous event

Comes with a catch.

Every promise

Contains an asterix.

The wise man comes to see that there is nothing to look forward to in this life.

What lies immediately before him

Is the only thing he can trust

And the only thing there is.

---

It is nether wrong nor right to tend to the needs of the body

It is, however, worthy to consider that this body that commands a man’s attention and devotion for his entire life

Is, even for the eternal optimist,

Headed toward a permanent grave.

---

A man’s ultimate Freedom

Lies in a total indifference

To the way he is treated.

---

"The reason that one makes an effort is in order to chase or to flee.

And because chasing and fleeing are reactive actions, they are not Truth

They harbor an ulterior motive

Thus, they are doomed to fail."

- The Myth Of Effort

---

Humans tend to be at their worst in the home environment

For that is where they are the most Attached.

---

The greatest preparation for life

Is to eliminate meaning and significance from all things.

---

A Pure Journey

To the pinnacle of the greatest mountain

Can only be made Alone.

For in the company of one’s peers,

A man suffers the distractions of comparison and competition

And, in so doing,

Wastes precious years

Precious talents

And precious possibilities.

---

The man who is desperate to arrive at The Truth

With a blatant disregard for his opinions,

Lives a uniquely extraordinary life

And becomes privy to what few men ever come to know.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is through logic how we arrive to the truth?

@Marcos80390591 Logic keeps one from The Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is a calculated risk under uncertain conditions? If one wants to be in sales or marketing, what is the merit of going into a field he knows like computer science if he is not a good salesperson or marketer?

@lioninawhat A risk that is calculated will not yield The Ultimate.

It is best to find that which you cannot help but to "risk" everything for.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is part of the mind subconscious? If so can it be conquered consciously?

@thunderbythesea Nothing can be conquered through effort, practice, and prescriptions

All can be conquered through Understanding.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why are we here? How can I find my purpose?

@Beef_010 There is no purpose.

Truth lies in discovering that the "you" that is here

Does not allow you to be Here.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What am I looking for when I'm feeling anxious and trying to escape from said anxiety ?

@ekastelano Pleasure.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I want to know what I really want in this life. At some thought I knew but slippled trough my fingers. I try to imagine my life but from some time it does not work anymore, I feel lost again and cannot imagine my life and chose a path. How can I find out? Thank you

@CryptoZ22962365 A life spent firmly entrenched in the cognizance of Not Knowing

Is not a wasted life.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Most of the times , I do not work to accomplish/succeed, I always work to fail safe. What is it that i am not seeing ?

@Assembledchaos That is your way of "succeeding"

---

@KapilGuptaMD What should be the primary aim/goal when whatever you do happens to fail eventually?

What should be the course correction method?

@SoulfulCircus Realizing viscerally

What you have just stated intellectually.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Your thoughts on the importance of persistence ? Thank you.

@Someshchandran As a prescription, it has no value.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the source of my and so many of your followers’ internal struggle — is it fighting against societal conditioning only? Or is the struggle / yearning built in to our DNA?

@chhhris All struggle arises from not having seen The Truth

Not having seen The Truth arises from being lost in a world of prescriptions.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What’s your definition of the Truth?

@aalamer84 Cannot define it

It is a road away from all prescriptions

And arriving at that which truly IS

And leaving behind that which exists only in the mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I fear for the future and this gives me waves of sadness and fustration. What I fear is very real though far away. I have trouble accepting it when I know it will happen at some point. Will I always suffer or will I attain peace before the event horizon? Thank you

@Glarmo Even if every hope in a man's life came true,

He will have suffered his life away hoping for it.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is being “a natural” at some skill merely another illusion? Is there something that allows one to be a natural at everything?

@jimmpierce Innate Talent indeed exists

To Understand everything

Is the greatest talent.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I wish to understand the nature of urgency. Immediate problems seem to create the pressure to solve themselves, but what is the nature of the pressure that can change a man permanently?

@kutaisi5 There are many possibilities

One is the visceral understanding that he has no time left

That he is about To Die.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Nearly every time I have had what I term a momentary glimpse of reality I have found myself feeling incredibly moved, some sort of beautiful sadness that nevertheless feels really good, and often laughing hysterically at all of us. Is this a reliable indicator of anything?

@MutualArising The most important indicator

Is the pleasure you received from it

And the pleasure that keeps you seeking it.

The Truth is not a Chase.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have so many projects. And goals. And ideas. But been going round in circles for years. How do I choose where to focus?

@thenewc0l0mb0 It is perhaps best to focus upon the one which provides satisfaction even in times of failure.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it wise to not to tell our children about the suffering of this world until they are of age?

@RawasMohamed2 The only suffering a man cares about

And the only one that matters

Is his own.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is it effortless to lose oneself in the craft they love, yet find losing themselves in other things in life not that effortless? Is the desire to lose oneself a true desire or just another trick the mind plays to keep one chasing?

@DebneilM If used as a prescription, it is a trick

If one realizes that he is at his best in those times that he has lost himself

One begins to Understand.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Are all the questions asked by the mind?

@RamonVasquezM All except the truly Sincere ones.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it possible to regulate the thinking process through deliberate effort born out of strong conviction and understanding?

@iyerkum This is the concept of "mindfulness"

And fails every time.

---

@iyerkum This is the concept of "mindfulness"

And fails every time.

@danomarr Things begin to transform within a human

When all chases lose their luster.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sometimes you get motivation to do something worthwhile and "good" and you are boosted and next day you are still laying wasting your time. Does this mean one is not serious about his dreams?

@MundraShivansh That which is done through motivation is also a waste

For motivation fades.

That which is done to be "good" is also a waste

For good and bad are not Truth.

---

The Truth is a path away from all doctrines

All practices

All austerities

All rituals

All beliefs

All penances

All hope

All striving

All spiritualities

These are made to appease the masses.

The Truth is for the man who is desperate for IT

Rather than "the way" to IT.

---

Freedom

Lies in freedom from the notion

That there is something to attain.

---

"Only the one who has recognized the insignificance of a thing can pursue it in a manner that is serious

Only the one who has recognized the insignificance of a thing can pursue it in Freedom without turmoil."

---

The man who seeks to Arrive

By one manner or another, Arrives.

The man who does not truly seek to Arrive,

"Works hard."

---

Society has told you a romantic lie

You do not have to "work for it"

Or "pay your dues."

You simply have to know the Backdoor Path that takes you there.

---

@KapilGuptaMD In one of your discourses you said the secret to become world class is to do the thing for the thing itself not for the reward. For someone who wants wealth how can one know if his desire is genuine and not just wanting the pleasurable aspects of it?

@MatimbeMarco Your desire is not genuine

But if avoiding pleasure

Or being genuine

Becomes a rule to live up to

He will go nowhere.

---

@KapilGuptaMD For someone who is convinced of the Truth but has not discovered it, where should effort be focused on in his journey towards it?

@iyerkum If one is Serious

He will be interested in ridding himself of all in his life that is a lie

Beginning with his beliefs and opinions.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master 

What causes the side effect called Success?

What Understanding will arrive myself at the futility of Striving and Hardwork

---

@KapilGuptaMD Are we here for some purpose or just part of evolution as random creature?

@parthchawda56 There is no purpose

But if one finds Truth

Life becomes easily livable.

---

@KapilGuptaMD If my craft represents hard work, is not really my craft?

@emsagahon Only a deeply conditioned societal man would create a craft called "hard work"

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it possible for one in his pursue of sucess if he discover the truths about his industry not to become anxious or be attatched to the outcome?

@MatimbeMarco Any sentence that begins with "is it possible"

Makes it Impossible for the individual who is asking.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I am making limited progress at work.

I do not want to continue wasting my own time.

What question will give the me immediate clarity to drop all that I am doing to limit myself in my work?

@ArtplusCrypto What is keeping me from realizing Viscerally

What I have just stated Intellectually.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I want to have maximum with doing minimum.

Is is possible ?

Why one feels guilty to see it this way ?

@ZobairSiddique Conditioning.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is practicing not a requirement for excellence in performance?

@AdastraFinMx Human beings practice that which they already know how to do

And as a penance in hopes that they will be rewarded for their troubles.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the nature of feedback in the path to mastery?

@Assembledchaos Results.

@KapilGuptaMD Results depend on many factors, how should I interpret the result to improve specifics of the craft.

@Assembledchaos And where precisely one wishes to go

Did one get there

Or not?

That is the only result worth measuring.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is a practical sign to differentiate between hard work in the flow and hard work as a path to burn out? Thanks

@PlamenPetrov Hard work

In any of its cleverly used forms

Is a manifestation of Anxiety.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What understanding is required to not get attached to the one goal a person finds worthwhile dedicating everything to

@PhilMullerSA The consequences of attachment

Seen first hand.

---

@KapilGuptaMD @KapilGuptaMD what makes individuals collaborate with each other? 

Common goals/desire/values?


@BinMohammmed Insecurity

Conditioning

Fear of being alone.

---

@KapilGuptaMD We experience negative feelings like striving/hardwork when our intention is incorrect? 

So instead of looking for a reward or compensation, do the thing because you love to do it? Just a natural inclination?

Is this the path to “arrival”?

@rubenbryans Absolutely not

You are looking to follow rules

This you will meet with failure.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I have felt the emptyness of domestic life. I see the futility of effort day in day out.

Yet, there is fear to start a new path. What am i waiting for?

@kap_flow Discover the nature of the fear.

---

The meditator is no different from the hedonist

The health nut is no different from the junk-food nut

Man is a pleasure-chaser

How ever he categorizes his chase.

He chases experiences

And calls it "progress."

He who loses his taste for pleasure

Is the one who truly Arrives

---

Self-blame is as futile as self-love

The latter is but a reaction to the former.

One's behavior is a natural consequence of his level of understanding, at any given moment in his life.

Realizing this, one moves away from the imprisoning concepts of good and evil.

---

A thing that is debated

Or institutionalized

Or celebrated

Or worshipped

Is seen only in name and form.

A Truth that is truly seen

Is seen quietly

Without excitement or celebration.

Like a leaf that quietly falls

In the dark of an ordinary night.

---

Quiet realizations

That are abandoned the moment they are heard,

Allow the seed to penetrate without the flash and pomp of the rind.

And are prevented from ballooning into significance

Within the theater of the Mind.

---

There is nothing quite so satisfying

As allowing one's eyes to see only Wisdom

And allowing one's ears to hear only Wisdom

For the Mind becomes saturated in the waters in which it is continually immersed

One becomes that which he continually sees, hears, and speaks.

---

Accept not

Deny not

And yours will be a life untroubled

---

The pitfalls of life are strategically placed

In order to trap the man who proudly pretends to know what he is doing.

---

Tomorrow, next month, or next year

May move in your favor, or against.

But one thing is for certain:

You will wreck yourself hoping for it.

---

Truth is far less accessible to the spiritual and the religious

Than to the heathen and the atheist.

---

There is nothing quite so satisfying

As allowing one's eyes to see only Wisdom

And allowing one's ears to hear only Wisdom

For the Mind becomes saturated in the waters in which it is continually immersed

One becomes that which he continually sees, hears, and speaks.

---

There is not a single pursuit in a man's life

That is not a procrastination.

---

Isolation from the world

Is a natural effect

Of those in whom Understanding begins to dawn.

---

"The Present Moment" is discovered

By the one who has seen with his very own eyes

The Cliff . . . at the end of every "path."

---

The man who asks "How," is the one who does not care to know.

The man who seeks "debate and discussion" is the one who seeks to show what he knows.

---

Man cannot bring himself to objectively examine what truly it is that he does in any 24-hour period

For this is the sort of shame that is best left unknown.

---

Objectively examining one's life

The serious man comes to the conclusion that each and every thought he has 

Is about "himself"

Of things and people that are "his"

Of things "he" would like to have

And ways he would like to "feel."

There is Nothing other than this.

---

If a man were held hostage for a year

Not allowed to think about "himself"

Not allowed to think about "others"

Not allowed to seek pleasure

And not allowed to seek "self-improvement"

What would he think?

What would he do?

(A question for yourself. Not seeking responses).

---

Whether or not your child speaks to you or respects you, or if you are adored or ridiculed by the world matters not. 

For even if all was just as you liked it, you would feel temporary pleasure, followed by permanent dissatisfaction.

Thus, Nothing matters

And All is for naught

---

Perhaps a life of Anonymity

Ruthlessly preserved

Is the truest and most effective life of all.

---

"Man must come to the understanding that there is no pursuit, achievement, or activity in existence that will satiate the human heart

And that there is no amount of book knowledge in the world that will satisfy his thirst."

@KapilGuptaMD what is the biggest problem of man?

@tj_dozier7 Belief in a Self.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Forgive me, I feel bad to ask, but is socialization a necessity for healthy mental life?

@ndsa1208 If one is burdened by the fear of loneliness, he has little choice but to socialize

Forcing anything upon oneself brings problems.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What does it look like for one to have arrived?

@Nothin2Much He understands all

Without frameworks, "mental models," or intellectualization

---

@KapilGuptaMD is to be mindless-ness to lose the mind narrator? when this occurs there still is an underlying self to act from?

@satts5 The mind-less man is a prisoner who has been set free

He acts by purity

Rather than by compulsive reaction to a self-centered desire.

---

@KapilGuptaMD The fundamental reason why I am drawn towards what you say, is it any different from what brings people to religion & spiritual gurus?

@notetwomyself For each person it is different

Most go for blessings and prescriptions.

Since there are none of those here

You will have to decide for yourself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How can you influence others who don’t want your practical advice?

@think__thank By recognizing that the problem is yours

The "ego of the helper"

---

@KapilGuptaMD What is the actual cause of poverty / financial lack?

@SaintChemeleon Not truly desiring to make money.

---

@KapilGuptaMD What do mean by “Arriving”? Is arriving being?

@kevinthomaschen Arriving at the Ultimate

Coming to Permanence.

The end of all striving.

The end of all chases.

Realization.

Understanding.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How one can deal with regrets?

@elims_smile You cannot really "deal with" anything.

"Dealing with" is a shell game of the "new age" and  "self-improvement" industry.

@KapilGuptaMD What's the way to remove the sufferring of regrets? Actually, I partially know the answer. Thoughts have created the regrets. If there are no thoughts there would be no regrets....but removing the thoughts...

@elims_smile One must come to the realization that one's actions are an offspring of his understanding

The errors that one makes are not evil in their intent

They are errors of ignorance

Rather than errors of a "good" or "bad" person.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How important is it to maintain a schedule for every day?

@chunax "Important" has no universal meaning

Routine does tend to keep one away from destructive habits.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Who were your teachers?

@m_flynner None.

@m_flynner Except Life

And circumstance.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Does the mind intentionally create an ego/identity or is this due to society's conditioning?

@mmbe27 Mind cannot survive without ego or identity.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Dear Sir, I recently realized that bad karma is not only in acts but in mind/bad thinking too. One can avoid bad acts but how to avoid bad thinking, envy, jealousy from mind.
Any thoughts Sir.

@prashu125 Where there is a preservation of the Self

There will be a Mind.

Where there is a Mind

There will be the defilements you speak of.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master, I find that spending my time fully engaged with my craft is not enough and there is a hunger for something about which I can't say much other than it seems beyond my reach and difficult to put in words.  what is this that I'm seeking?

@Charliek913 Different humans use different words

Permanence, satisfaction, peace, realization . . .

---

If a serious man objectively examines his life, he discovers that his entire life has been a series of lies, empty promises, prescription chases, and fleeing this and that.

If sincerity lives anywhere within him, he will understand that he must Arrive 

Before death arrives.

---

The world is chasing "mindfulness."**

**But Truth lies in Mindlessness.**

---

Examine the nature of your thoughts

And you will discover that they are always in search of a dose of pleasure.

Circumstances that you would like to go your way

And situations that did not.

This is your entire experience of life

There is nothing else.

---

The results an individual receives are not a function of what he “does”

They are a function of what he is convinced of.

---

When reading The Private Discourses

Allow not your mind to turn them into a prescription.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt This constant underlying need to disprove my insecurity in social situations, it's like I'm always coming from this place to disprove the fear inside of me. I see I'm often attached to a certain outcome and that causes a lot of the anxiety but it is automatic at this point.

@zoe_slows The Truth lies not in becoming Secure

It lies in viscerally and non-intellectually resting in the fact that insecurity exists within you.

Without the compulsion to fight it.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I struggle with the concept of creating the future because my entrepreneurial efforts feel like an attachment to a tomorrow. What should be understood about this self-conflict when my way of being doesn’t feel forced?

@rkroeger13 You are attempting to create a future based upon pleasure and reward

This is the cause of your struggles.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I see a possibility in my mind. But when I translate it to physical reality (writing) what I put on paper feels less grand and satisfying than the pure internal possibility did. It frustrates me. 

What is the nature of this situation?

@jaycrosstweets Your desire to produce/succeed/become validated

Is stronger than your desire for Purity.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt In living in an emerging economy seemingly always on the edge of a cliff, anxiety seems to try to drive one to safer, more stable jurisdictions. What is the truth around this apparent risk reward if one's talent is assumed to be around finding opportunities and growing businesses

@PhilMullerSA When reward is considered valuable

It becomes the hub of one's search.

This gives rise to the Anxiety

Of not achieving it.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt When I try to see all that the mind is doing, and all the ways that I am not it, is the mind still not the entity doing the seeing? How do I know when I experience something that is not mind?

@teebesz When there is no intellectualization

And no chase for happiness or pleasure or self-image.

---

The thing that can easily consume you for the rest of your life is The Thing

All else is done for empty pleasure

And this Forever leaves one . . . empty.

---

FINDING TRUE PEACE IN YOUR LIFE

No "working on yourself"

No "prescriptions"

No "exercises"

No "meditation"

No "spirituality"

No "forgiveness, apologies, gratitude, journaling, or love yourself"

Simply, The Truth.

---

A man is beginning to learn the Truth about life

When he is no longer surprised by anything.

---

A man’s most urgent necessity

Is neither happiness or money.

It is Wisdom.

For it is wisdom that he will need to navigate the turbulent waters of his day to day existence

Without succumbing to the ocean of turmoils

Or to the empty road of prescriptions.

---

It is easy to lose one's way in this society

Making oneself immune to the temptations of the Mind is more devastatingly critical than it has ever been.

---

The problem with Reward  
Is that it feels good.  
The problem with feeling good  
Is that it is pleasurable.  
The problem with pleasure  
Is that man enjoys it beyond compare.  
Thus, such a one is chained to hankering for a reward 
And, therefore, he is doomed to a life of anxiety.

---

KapilGuptaMD Why attachments are so attractive and interesting, apart from destructive ?  

@ZobairSiddique Because they provide the opportunity for pleasure.

---

The Simple Secret To Acquiring Genuine Wisdom:

He who has learned to view every situation 

Without the lens of "himself" or the "other"

Will find himself on the path to genuine wisdom.

---

The one thing that we, as humans, cannot afford

Is the incessant burden of Ourself.

---

Having an opinion,

A man will hold onto it.

Having held onto it,

He will become it.

Having become his opinion,

He will live forever in conflict

With the world

And himself.

---

Give not advice to your children

Give not help to your fellow man.

For wisdom lies not in Giving,

But in understanding the nature of human beings.

Keep all things to yourself,

Until the sincerity of the one standing before you

Leaves you no choice but to Give.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I add something to my task list: it is the kiss of death. Adding means I have promised myself that the action means something, and the significance frightens me, prevents movement. How do I organise myself with purity, without thought of outcome?

@maxaitken When the outcome does not mean so much to you anymore

Until that point, attempting to not think about outcome, while harboring a desire for it will create anxiety and lead to failure.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I fail to see the imaginary person that "I" am protecting etc...
I only know rationaly that it exists, through your discourses,
depsite the constant uncontrollable chattering in my head.
Any advice on what I must explore to break the illusion/belief?

@MatevzRopret That imaginary person is ego.

Do not attempt to rid yourself of it

Notice its patterns. 

And the sorts of turmoil it brings you.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Most of my problems would be solved by discovering Who I Want to be.

But for some reason, I don’t want to figure out what I “Want”. When I ask, I ask reflexively, instead of with Sincerity. 

Why don’t I Sincerely want to figure out what I Want? Is the Mind preventing me?

@aman_ramnani Yes 

But do not fight the mind

Discover what the mind wants.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt The stripping away of layers of truth leaves me with a sense of loss without clarity on what I am actually searching for. How do I navigate this while still physically living in the world and society around me?

@Ymindel Discover the emptiness in the things you have been thus far in your life been compelled to search for.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt How might one separate a pleasure chase from the pursuit of one's art? When might the pursuit of art become an escape or a chase? Thanks.

@arete_light Do not fear the pleasure chase

Pursue the art

If there is anxiety, there is a chase happening.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt What lets one viscerally see that, there is No Time and arrive at seriousness to stop procrastinating?

@danielpsegundo The natural death of the desire for pleasure

---

The single, discontinuous moment

Is all there is.

Memory haphazardly links them into an imaginary saga that one comes to know as “his life.”

---

**It is for this reason that the wise man lives the life of a recluse.**
 
**It is for this reason that the wise man speaks to very few human beings.**
 
**For there is only so much Truth that a societal man can bear.**
 
**How many layers of himself can he afford to burn?**
 
**How much of his life is he willing to admit is a lie?**
 
**How much of the house that he has spent his entire life building, is he willing to take a bulldozer to?**
 
**How many sacred cows can he condemn to the chopping block?**
 
**It is simply . . . too much.**
 
---

What most greatly contributes to a man's struggles

What blinds him to The Truth

Is the shadow of his own ego.

Not because it states that he is grand

But because it states that he exists at all.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt Is everything the mind comes up with ultimately a distraction

@satts5 Yes.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt I see that my preferences of like and dislike are entirely conditioned yet I am still at the whim of them, I suffer immensely when things are “that” way and not “this” way, and in trying to go beyond it I just bring more conflict. how is one to transform his default state?

@zoe_slows By understanding firmly that one is in that place.

---

@KapilGuptaMDpvt In examining anxiety, I recognize the “luxury” that living with it provides - I seem to thrive on managing its presence - it seems it gives me something to do - what is required to be free of this “addiction”

@michaeljbarry1 You gain too much pleasure from it to let it go.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Master: How does one find his passion? That for which one get paid to play?

@Marcos80390591 If you had but 6 months to live, discover what precisely you would do.

@KapilGuptaMD I only find reactive answers such as "traveling, enjoy all my money, etc"

@Marcos80390591 You have not looked.

Because you are too eager to find "an answer."

---

@KapilGuptaMD What can we learn from suffering?

@Rmtpk1 You must stop reading spirituality books.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one find focus for his work?

@ty_wolf By first discovering desire.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Since all a human perceives is mind, how do we overcome it through the same mind?

@mmbe27 It is not about overcoming anything.

It is about seeing what is there.

This leads to Freedom.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why do I keep going in circles and feel stagnant? Like im not moving forward just same place and feeling stuck/lost/sad #helpme

@JR98117 Because you have not discovered where it is you wish to go.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one measure success?

@MarkIacolina It is an empty word

Each person creates his own empty definition.

---

@KapilGuptaMD As more answers come to me, I only have more questions. Does this end? And if it doesnt end, being all part of the journey, where does it actually lead?

@ChucklezK Nothing leads anywhere.

The more refined and sincere the Question

The more it becomes an answer unto itself.

---

@KapilGuptaMD How does one become so sure of their self to know that they are helping people and not destroying them? Despite what the people their trying to help has to say.

@ChucklezK As long as you are sure of "yourself"

You will destroy your life

And the lives of those around you.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Sometimes I have moments of pure clarity where the truth is obvious and the path is clear. But I don’t know what causes them. They seem to come on their own. Is it possible to be that way all the time?

@iwearahoodie Your desire to have them

Keeps them away.

@KapilGuptaMD yes. I couldn’t see that before. Now that you’ve said it it seems obvious. Thanks

---

@KapilGuptaMD Does the inquiry into “who am I” or “ am I aware” done with sincerity have the potential to reveal the Truth?

@iyerkum Anything done with devotion and sincerity has the potential to reveal Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I am likely as free and unbound as I will be in this life (single, have savings/time/health etc). 

I desire a meaningful use of my time.

You advise to discover/look/explore within to find that which we desire.

Would you expound more on how this is best done? 

Thank you 🙏🏻

@sivano The man who has everything

Has the greatest luxury in the world:

To devote his life to gain freedom from his mind

And discover The Truth.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Why is life unpredictable?

@i_am_manishdas Why does the wind blow a leaf to the right, and not to the left?

---

@KapilGuptaMD Hi Kapil, why mind creates state sadness , emotion, angry for not fall into this trap what one must understand

@_ravi That this is the nature of mind.

---

@KapilGuptaMD I feel stuck. I no longer have any overwhelming desires, because I know where they lead. I don’t know what to do with the rest of my time. I don’t even have the need to do anything, but I find it preferable to nothing. How did you disover what you wanted to do with your life?

@jimmpierce There is nothing to do.

There is nothing to lament.

---

@KapilGuptaMD Is it possible to rid the mind of improper thoughts?

@Mirage5 No.

---

All teachers and coaches

In all domains

Succumb to giving prescriptions.

For if they do not,

They will have no students.

Thus, there is no effective teaching

And no effective student.

It is all, in the end,

A pretending.

A shameless waste of a human life.
