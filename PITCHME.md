"Spending your life exactly the way you wish to spend it is a wonderful liberation."

~from "Atmamun" by @KapilGuptaMD

---

Unfortunately, this is what sometimes happens when I choose to take Questions 

Q: What do I do? 
A: The secret is located 4 steps right, and two steps forward 
Q: Do I walk or drive? Left foot first? Or right one? What stride? How big are these "steps?"

Addicted to prescriptions.

---

I will only tell you this: Even if every person in the world approved of you, precisely to the degree and specifications that you dictated One week later You would be lost in another form of anxiety.
    
---

All Conflict is Self-Conflict

---

Life is not about: 
- Enjoyment. Never lasts 
- Pleasure. Never satisfies 
- Family. An extension of the ego 
- Spiritual Austerities. Prescriptions that lead to themselves 
- Success. A chase for empty things 
- Life is about Arriving so completely That one experiences no Thought And no Need.

---

I have spent my life and my career creating Questions 
Questions that seep into the bloodstream 
Questions that spawn Transformations 
Questions that create Cures
I will now share with you a Question to ask your child: "What is it that I have never really understood about you?"

---

Le No Mind pourrait se rapprocher du "Tranquility of the mind" des Stoic called "Ataraxia" ou du "Nirvana" Budhiste

---

The miracle is not Enlightenment

The miracle is that which compels man to live a life of Suffering.

Man is God

For only a god could create, out of perfectly thin air, a universe full of illusions to imprison himself by.

---

If one creates a thin layer of space

Between himself and his mind

Between himself and every person in his life

He will be able to sustain himself gloriously

In this one, life-saving pocket of air

Amidst the crashing waves of his life.

---

Actions arise from a compulsion

Compulsions arise from a need for pleasure.

At the fundament of it all

The actions that one considers "important"

Are the ones that harbor the most potential for pleasure.

---

Everything, in time, returns to itself

Every straight line

Eventually becomes a circle.

---

The only lasting satisfaction

Is the end of all searches

For satisfaction.

---

Humans does not respond to what you say

They respond to what they hear.

This is because of the history that you have with them

And the insecurities that they harbor.

---

If I recall, I discussed in my first book, Atmamun
That if a man surrenders himself whole to a god, it would serve him greatly.
The Truth is, who or what a man surrenders himself to is irrelevant
It is the very separation of him from himself that sets him free

Whether a man surrenders himself to the universe
Or to a benevolent god
He will have the weight of life lifted from his shoulders

---

Thought creates the prison cell of man

The walls, the cement floor, and the bars

Within the cell is a window through which one sees the sky and the trees, a place of happiness and freedom

Thought creates this as well

Ultimate Freedom lies in No-Thought.

---

Man cannot make a decision

Without second-guessing himself.

For decisions are made by the intellect

And the intellect, no matter how well-informed

Can never be certain.

---

This is the problem with us human beings. Receiving something is not enough. Becoming something is not enough. Feeling something is not enough. No matter how grand or majestic that thing may be, we must spoil it with reason. We must graffiti our logic across its sacred presence.

---

The human who is interested in "practices"

Society has many tricks, techniques, and options for him.

The human who is interested in Arrival

Society has nothing to offer him.

---

Blaming another brings problems
Blaming yourself brings problems
Needing another brings problems 
Pretending not to need them brings problems 
Being selfish brings problems 
Being benevolent brings problems
Doing something or nothing brings problems 

Understanding is Freedom.

---

The Master is busy Seeing

The novice is busy Doing.

---

The technical aspect of one’s art, sport, craft, or business

Is NEVER where the money is.

Literally and figuratively.

---

"Man’s greatest folly lies in believing that something cannot happen unless he himself does it

Yet the movements of the planets seek not his permission nor his expertise

And his very life lies in the hands of a heart that functions independently of him"

---

"For the secret that man does not know is that he pursues the hard, out of a longing for the Soft

He pursues action, out of a longing for Sight

He accumulates, out of a longing for Emptiness

He pursues the intellect, out of a longing for Art."

---

Understand this Truth: An action that is a reaction is not a True action. It is a non-action. And a non-action must result in problems.

---

Thought creates the situation
Thought creates the problems
Thought creates the deficiencies
Thought creates the solutions
Thought creates the hope
Thought creates the disappointment
Thought creates the happiness
Thought creates the despair

Thought creates the Thinker.

---

Siddha Secret: Epiphanies

The thing about Epiphanies . . .

The reason they do not last . . .

Is because the Mind creates excitement about having discovered it

So that it may use this excitement to cleverly whisk one away from the epiphany

Back into the Mind

---

One cannot truly let go of the past
Until
He let’s go of the very idea of the past.

The Present 
So swiftly becomes the past 
That by the time one looks for it 
It is gone.

Everything that a human being sees
Is history unfolding before his eyes.
It has already died
What remains visible are the skeletal remains


---

The most inspiring feature of nature is The Great Mountain 
It is unaffected by nature’s wrath 
It is serene, regardless of the moon or the season 
It is uncompromising to all of earth’s creatures 
It asks not 
It takes not 
It simply stands tall
As an inspirational possibility.

---

- "The real doing is a non-doing. The ultimate action is understanding. The ultimate action is recognition. Seeing is the ultimate doing. Seeing is more doing than any possible doing you could do."

- "A fact of human nature, which is that unless a human being is required to do something, he wont."
    - Unless a human's back is against the wall, unless he feels a consequence, he will not be compelled to do anything other than what is most instinctive and readily available to him/her
    - "No human being acts unless there is a consequence

---

Be wary of reading for knowledge. For this knowledge will die with you. If something is of utilitarian value for a particular pursuit, this is useful. If you read in order to pad your intellect, in anticipation of sounding intelligent at social gatherings, both you and the one who is listening to you will have created yet another opportunity for experiencing a hollow evening. The one who is not burdened by knowing, but is Invested with Wisdom, takes the flight of the eagle. He soars through the heavens throughout his time on earth.

---

Excitement and Pleasure

            The impetus for your every action. The action that is done without excitement, pleasure, regret, or strife is an action that has a chance of providing satisfaction. Any silvery thing that awaits you on the horizon is a mirage. Every “tomorrow” is, and will always be, empty. This one statement will either set one on a lifelong chase to verify it. Or it will save him decades of torment. Whichever way you may choose to go, do not “believe” me.

x

Uncompromise

            To halves Never make anyone whole.

---

What a man can accomplish by Caring Pales in comparison To what he can accomplish by Not Caring At All.

---

If you had only one or two years to live, no one would be ‘managing’ anything. People would seek CURES. The reason that we manage things, is because we know and we feel, rightly or wrongly, correctly or incorrectly, that we’re going to be here for a long time

---

Behind every action is a reactivity

A reactive attempt to avoid pain

Or attract pleasure.

Thus, all motivations be they positive or negative

Arise from an impure seed.

A Pure Action

Is thought-less, reason-less, and intention-less

It arises from a place beyond The Mind.

---

It is only when a human being becomes whole within himself, that he is good to himself or to any other human being.

It is only when he genuinely arrives at a place of needing nothing or no one that he is able to receive without pleasure, or to give without hope.

What a human seeks above all else in this life is Freedom.

And this freedom can only be provided by one thing, and one thing only:

The Truth.

---

A realization that changes Everything

Is that Pleasure,

Including even the pleasure of being loved,

Is simply not worth

A life of torment.

---

The Buddhists, unfortunately, are not serious

They have trivialized the purity of this Sincere Indian Sage

They have reduced his teachings into prescriptions

And settled for a life of "discipleship."

They have reduced the most inspiring man I have ever known

Into an "ism."

---

The world passes each other feel-good messages while sitting in one spot for their entire lives

They do this in order to give themselves the illusion of movement

So that they may secretly remain where they are.

---

The reason that we waste time is because Living Life is very low on our list of priorities.

And Living Routines is very high on the list.

---

As a man approaches the precipice of Wisdom,

Books contain nothing but blank pages

Philosophies are intellectual procrastinations

Religions are based upon the fear of god

Society is an external manifestation of the chaos that is mind

And Nothingness is the greatest Truth.

---

There is no greater evidence of man's inner sorrows

Than the ubiquitousness of alcohol.

---

Fame loses its luster

Wealth loses its novelty

Privileged circles lose their charm

Success loses its excitement.

What remains

Is the glorious pursuit of losing oneself

And forgetting oneself.

This never loses its charm.

This is the Highest of Arts.

---

There will come a time when I will leave @Twitter
 
There will come a time when I will leave this world.

If there is anything you must learn

It is this:

Devote yourself to seeing the way things Truly Are

Seek not the reactive paths of happiness and pleasure

---

Siddha Secret: BOREDOM

Boredom is not a problem to be treated

It is a sign to be understood.

A sign of the Mind's perpetual craving for pleasure.


---

Art is the only domain in which a human is free to be the one whom society has never allowed him or her to be.

It is for this very reason

That Art is Truth.

---

If one cancels his journal subscriptions

Surrenders his certifications

Burns his books

Says goodbye to his "friends"

Fires his instructors and mentors

Avoids conferences and meetings like the plague

And cares not a drop what the world thinks of him

He will become a Master.

---

A human lives perfectly and performs perfectly when he is Clear

He is clear when he has no self-concept.

---

The Truth is Not that one must become content with what he has. It is the realization that nothing that he has can bring contentment

--- 

To Be ELITE

  - It's not about figuring out what you can do to perform better, it's about realizing what the problems, or the things you haven't realized, are, that have hampered your performance
    - The former may make you 5% better
    - But the latter has the potential to blow the doors open& by way of understanding

---

The Nature of Your Fears Have Consequences 

  - "If you're afraid of losing, or not becoming a success, then you'll go down the path of hard work and struggle. But, if you're afraid of not learning the absolute truth, and that's what you're truly afraid of&how good you could have been&then you'll go down the path of mastery."

---

The Master's greatest mistake

Is in attempting to convince the unconvincable

And reach

The unreachable.

He must come to peace with the fact that,

As difficult as it is to see humans walk the path of destruction,

Only an infinitesimal few

Are Ready for The Truth.

---

The highest realization of a Seeker

Is that he is afraid of Finding.

For this Finding

Will rob him of the pretense to seek

And of the wholly familiar, and painstakingly-created, image of being a “seeker.”

---


The path of striving and achievement leads only to endless frustration

Pure Mastery of craft and of Mind

Is the only sustainable joy and satisfaction.

---

The only things you should believe are the things that don't require belief, and those are your own direct experiences

---

- "It is foolish to try and bring a human being out of his miseries, because of the implicit belief that the person wants to be relieved of his miseries"
    - "There is great pleasure in misery"
      - Where there is misery, there is comfort - it's home for many of us

---

"Responsibility" is a societal construct

It is an idea that is Forced upon a human

As are all Rules.

That which is done authentically

That which has no name attached to it

That which is not an ideal that one is attempting to live up to,

Has Power

And creates a True Impact.

---

Siddha Truth: Self
Where there is a Me
There will be a My.
It cannot be otherwise.

---

What comes
Always goes.
This is what I have learned.

---

The humm of the air conditioner
The splashing of a water droplet
The sound of a bird’s beak against the hollow trunk of an oak
These are the greatest Truths.

---

As I sit in a high-back chair

Peering across the Great Forest that unfolds outside my window

I examine the Nature of Desire

And what I find is not that desire is inherently good or evil

Rather, the evil lies in the Effects that overcome a man

When this desire is unfulfilled.

---

The Master's greatest mistake

Is in attempting to convince the unconvincable

And reach

The unreachable.

He must come to peace with the fact that,

As difficult as it is to see humans walk the path of destruction,

Only an infinitesimal few

Are Ready for The Truth.

---

Definition Of A "Scholar":

One who confines knowledge to the air-tight compartment of his intellect

So that he may prevent it from entering his bloodstream.

---

The highest realization of a Seeker

Is that he is afraid of Finding.

For this Finding

Will rob him of the pretense to seek

And of the wholly familiar, and painstakingly-created, image of being a “seeker.”


----

94 percent of the things that are done in a company

Like 94 percent of the things that are done in professional athletics

Are a function of neither strategy, nor productivity, nor necessity, nor art

They are a function of Anxiety.

The same can be said of Religion.

For the religious do not Love God

As much as they Fear him.

---

The path of Competition

Is the path of Anxiety.

It cannot be otherwise.

---

In order to create a company 

That is unlike any in the history of human civilization

It must be an Autocracy.

---

There is a subtle presence within a human that remains unaffected by anything that may happen to him.

This is what he must access, if he seeks to become Free.

---

Knowing in one's heart

That nothing or no one is coming

Allows one to become Free, and live in satisfaction.

Hoping in one's mind

That something or someone might come

Keeps one anxious and imprisoned forever.

---

"Poor audio quality" weeds out the casual, the curious, and the insincere.

--- 

If one acquired the ability to never think about himself for the remainder of his lifetime

He would never again be subject to so much as an ounce of emotional turmoil.

---  

The wise action

In any interpersonal circumstance

Is the action that does not arise from attachment

Or create attachment.

--- 

The decision is Wise

If it does not produce self-conflict.

--- 

Life Satisfaction does not arise from austerities or "working on oneself"

It arises from a Realization of the way things truly are.

This Realization can only enter

Into the one who is more desirous of a Lifetime of Satisfaction

Than a moment of "happiness."

--- 

The child seeks to become an adult

The adult seeks to become a child.

One seeks the world

The other seeks a respite from it.

One seeks a foray into adventure

The other seeks a return to innocence.

One seeks to become something new

The other seeks to become who he once was.

--- 

As one walks a sincere and systematic Journey toward Truth

He experiences Surprises

He suddenly notices that he no longer experience certain anxieties

A keen clarity opens up within him

And because these arrive without effort, prescription, or practice

They never leave him.

--- 

  - "If man wishes to pursue something, because the pursuit gives him the opportunity to lose himself, losing oneself provides a sense of engagement, and engagement provides a sense of freedom from the torture that is his mundane life. THAT is useful."
    - But what he gains from that, the end product, will turn to dust

--- 

There is an intelligence within a human being

That his intellect cannot hope to match.

It is in exploring this mysterious elixir within him

That a human stands witness to,

And gains access to,

His Perfection

And his Genius.

Namaste. 

--- 

Help is Offered

Far more than it is Desired.

--- 

A Journey toward Satisfaction

Rather than pleasure.

A Journey toward Dispassion

Rather than happiness.

A Journey toward Arrival

Rather than practice.

A Journey toward Wisdom

Rather than intelligence.

A Journey to cure all one's human frailties

And become Free.

--- 

WAITING

A human spends his entire life, Waiting.

Waiting to be chosen

Waiting to become successful

Waiting to be validated

Waiting to be loved

Waiting to be reciprocated

Waiting to be happy

Waiting to become content

A human spends his entire life . . . 

Waiting.

--- 

The Question that creates A Master:

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

What is it that I'm not seeing?

--- 

Man, in true and practical fact,

Creates his own reality.

He will have it just as he sees it.

But in order to see it,

His Mind must be trained in the most secret and delicate of ways.

--- 

What greater regret could possibly arise within a man

Than to realize, in the moments prior to his demise,

The Truth.

Which had he been privy to decades before

His life would have carried no resemblance

To the one that he lived.

--- 

One tries to string together drops of pleasure in order to create an ocean of satisfaction"
      - This does not work

--- 

Hold the world at arm's length

View it as a lovely and sentimental carnival

And the events of your life will not affect you.

--- 

The things that we understand, create Silence

The things that we do not, create Emotion.

--- 

The Truth lives inside of a moment.

This moment is a well-concealed escape hatch in a small corner of the sphere.

THIS . . . is all there is.

--- 

- To avoid mistakes in the future - don't focus on behavior fixes
    - Instead understand the source from which your actions arose 

---

How do you self-assess?

  - "It isn't about being nice to yourself, or critical of yourself, it isn't about what you did and what you should have done instead, it's about understanding why you did what you did and what specifically it was a reaction to" 

---

Happiness and sorrow are the same. Pain and pleasure are the same. There is perhaps no more impactful realization in a man’s life.

---

I think, as a human being, I should have a near-death-experience once per quarter

---

Each person has to reach and declare their non-negotiables, the thing(s) they cannot do or cannot keep from doing

---

To arrive at not caring what ANYONE thinks about you, not even your own family or your own kids, not your spouse, not your boss, not your audience, not your fans, not the media, to not reactively but to genuinely arrive at that place inside yourself because you no longer have to put on a face, that's an enormous milestone in a human being's life

---

When one seeks The Truth

He moves from a curiosity and a wonder about the world

Toward a contempt for the world

Culminating in an indifference to the world.


---

"Any attempt to force the mind against its habitual patterns is to incite it.

This is a war that no human has ever won.

What will transform you will not be a prescription, but a Space.

A space between the action, and the motivation behind this action"

---

When one arrives at a specific threshold of The Truth He no longer experiences Boredom. At another specific threshold He no longer experiences Sorrow.

---

In every problem, situation, or circumstance, there's always a truth. It is the source of a decision which categorizes it as Truth or not. This is Kapil's mode of attack in all things.

---

- "The only reason you don't have what you want, is because you didn't really want it." 
  - "The only reason you have the things you do, is because you couldn't live without them"
  - "The only reason you are where you are, is because somewhere in you, it's okay for you to be there"

---

All human beings seek engagement, to be lost in whatever they do - that is the central human desire

My sincerity and desire to live a sweet spot of a life, is to the absolute point of desperation. I do not want a single moment of a day to go by, that I do not truly feel immersed

---

The Secret is not to Win

But to win without having to compete.

---

When a human sees a magic trick, he is enthralled and excited.

When the trick is uncovered, the excitement fades.

Excitement and emotion arise when something is not understood.

As it is understood, one naturally becomes unfazed.

One naturally becomes equanimous.

He does not become equanimous because it is good to be equanimous.

He becomes equanimous because he sees the whole of the thing, without any gaps in his understanding.

The wise man is naturally quiet, subdued, and largely silent.

---

The real danger of arriving at The Truth

Is the indescribable pain for having so carelessly wasted all the prior years of his life.

---

A person does not react to the Insult

He reacts to what the insult makes him feel about himself.

---

The heights that a man reaches

Is a function of what he Fears Most.

For fears direct his step and his stride.

---

The Truest and most Effective response to anything your Mind says to you

Is not a single word

Nor a single thought.

---

Humans care less about what products Do for them

Than what the products Say about them.

---

The day that a man becomes unmoved by Pleasure

The Mind will run out of its fuel for Chatter.

---

Doing, hoping, practicing, ritualizing, and routine-ing are all an Empty Chase.

Such things are Followed because humans are more interested in "practicing" than they are in Arriving.

One Arrives not when he becomes Proficient at the "practices"

But when he grows Tired of them.

---

Impatience trumps patience

Sincerity trumps practice

Innocence trumps intelligence

Understanding trumps intellect

Purity trumps hard work

Solitude trumps socialization

Becoming trumps instructing

Seeing trumps doing

Truth trumps prescriptions.

---

The present can not be walked towards, it has to be backed into"

---

If someone calls one stupid, and that person gets angry, you have to examine why that person became angry - why did the anger arise?
    - If someone called you a cloud, would you get angry?
    - The reason the anger arose - when that person was called stupid, he or she for a moment, entertained the possibility that they were in fact stupid
      - When that possibility was entertained, the ego did not like the fact that part of them entertained the idea that they were stupid - this produces internal conflict which outwardly manifests itself as anger -THE TRUTH

---

The things that the mind tells me are correct, are almost never correct

---

If one examines his life, he discovers that he is in a constant state of Chasing and Fixing.

So ubiquitous is this experience in his life and in the lives of those around him that he never thinks to question this.

He has never realistically entertained a Life Free Of Problems.

---

But let us proceed in such a way as to Experience the Truth as we learn it. The mind is a clever beast, my King. Upon seeing what it is that we are trying to do, it will sabotage our efforts. And it will do so in the cleverest of ways. The cleverest of which is through Intellectualization.

---

A life of Preferences

Is a very difficult life.

---

"Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego. Ego is a habit of the self

And the self does not, in truth, exist

Thus, nothing in a man’s life is truly real

For reality is the nameless, identity-less, mind-less, and thought-less Void"

---

After one dies,

The happiness game ends

The money game ends

The relationship game ends

The success game ends

The self-improvement game ends

The parenting game ends

The status game ends

The fear of death game ends.

Everything in this life,

Is but a fleeting game.

---

The state of one’s Mind

Is the state of one’s Life.

---

When one is no longer attached to needing respect, love, or reciprocation, or for someone else to make him happy when one is no longer attached to the idea of happiness itself he becomes wildly free

---

Man's neuronal machinery conjoins man's experiences

This is known as Consciousness.

(And it is completely illusory).

Consciousness is the dream

It is Not the dreamer.

---

If there is a realization worthy of devoting a human life

If there is a realization that provides true freedom and permanent and sustained satisfaction

If there is an enlightenment of enlightenments

It is the practical realization that you Truly and Genuinely 

Do not exist.

---

In all domains

Truth and Popularity are mutually exclusive.

---

In order to understand this, one must understand that the journey of almost all men is not a Journey toward Truth. It is a Journey of aversions

---

Chases.

==Perfect Knowledge lies in the Question that no one has thought to ask.==

And so long as a man is enslaved to his need for validation, he will be limited to finding answers to the ones being asked.

Perfect Knowledge lies in the pure desire To Know.

Rather than in the desire to be seen as the one who knows

---

Life becomes effortlessly livable

When one no longer needs anything from it.

---

The wise man asks himself,

“How much are my opinions costing me?”

---

Man is a Universe Of One.

He is the striker and the stricken

The sinner and the forgiver

The winner and the congratulator

The needer and the giver

The melancholic and the consoler.

Man’s existence is a self-tight compartment

“Others” are but a grand illusion.

---

Man wants what he does not have

And ignores that which he has.

For man does not so much desire his wants

As much as he abhors being denied of them.

---

Humans are told to ask, How can I do the maximum?

They are enslaved to the false god of hard work

They are shackled to the myth of "doing more" than another.

The True Question is,

What is the maximum I can eliminate, so that I may focus my efforts upon the essential minimum?

---

To Arrive At Peace:

One must by organic and non-prescriptive means arrive at the understanding 

That neither life or its people

Can create for him a life of lasting satisfaction.

For lasting satisfaction can only be had

When one needs Not A Thing

From life, or its people.

---

Conflicts are not the result of behaviors observed

But of intentions perceived.

---

He who knows he is going to lose, feels no anxiety.

He who knows he will win by a stretch, feels no anxiety.

He who “competes,” is filled to the brim with anxiety.

---

Memory

Is perhaps the greatest burden.

---

Wisdom

Or lasting satisfaction

Or transformation

Cannot be found in practices or methodologies.

Such things arise within the human who longs directly for Them.

They do not arise in the human who longs to play the role of one who seeks them.

---

To like and dislike is a habit of the Mind

It binds man to the purgatory of craving and aversion.

If one trains the mind to have no likes or dislikes

He becomes equanimous.

This equanimity affords him the clarity to witness

The Nature of Things.

---

The wisest wish from a genie in a bottle would be:

To remove from a human

Every drop, trace, and shadow

Of Need.

Purity and Truth would naturally, and of their own accord,

Bloom in such a soil.

---

The Truth does not lie in feeling guilty

The Truth does not lie in apologies

The Truth does not lie in blame another or oneself

The Truth does not lie in encouragement, praise, or gratitude

The Truth does not lie in altruism or sacrifice

The Truth lies in Learning The Truth.


---

If man's entire life is lost in a world of thought, then what in his life is truly real?

Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego. Ego is a habit of the self.

And the self does not, in truth, exist.

Therefore, there is nothing in a man's life that is truly real

---

Siddha Secret: Self-Image

If a man looks closely, he will discover

That, in his mind's eye, 

He views himself differently

With every man that he meets.

---

Thought creates the disease. Thought creates the fix.

Thus, the fix does not cure the disease.

The fix . . . is the disease itself.

---

If man's entire life is lost in a world of thought, then what in his life is truly real?

Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego. Ego is a habit of the self.

And the self does not, in truth, exist.

Therefore, there is nothing in a man's life that is truly real.

For reality is the nameless, identity-less, mind-less, and thought-less Void.

Therefore, man's entire life is a chain of lies that spans three quarters of a century

---

The only human being that can find True Peace is the one who is able to withstand the inconceivable and outrageous indifference that is life

---

Man is endowed with the power to control outcomes.

This is achieved by controlling one’s interiority.

The power to control outcomes is lost if used to acquire pleasurable experiences

The power to control interiority is lost if prescriptions are employed.

---

“I do not know”

Is a sanctuary.

---

Pleasure

1) The Mind exists purely for pleasure
2) Food, socialization, entertainment, exercise, meditation, travel, spending, even chores
4) Every microsecond is a search for pleasure
5) In his entire life, a man will not do One Thing that does not in some way give him pleasure

---

Rain can only soak one who is dry

Pain can only hurt one who craves pleasure

Turmoil can only affect one who craves peace

Conflict can only harm one who craves harmony

Mud can only soil one who is clean.

The one who craves Nothing

Can be harmed by Nothing.

---

Man spends his entire life searching for the “right” way to be.

As promising as these “ways” seem

They all prove to be empty chases.

One must learn for himself that being  a Nobody 

Who is permanently embedded in the cocoon of a single moment

Is the end of all chases.

---

Why don't people search for the truth? 

  - Because the only loudspeaker they hear is the voice of society
    - The voice that says - "Be present", "Meditate", "Go to conferences"
      - "There is enough there to last a human being 50 lifetimes. When is he going to have the time to exhaust everything and find out none of them work?"
  - For your own transformation - All you need to know is that the voice of society has led you absolutely nowhere
  - "Knowing where 'it' isn't is far more instructive, practical, immediate, acute and powerful than knowing where 'it' is"

---

The Transformation that follows hearing The Truth

Is not so dependent upon the content of the particular Truth

As upon the Ripeness of the one who hears it.

---

Why don't human beings see the obvious?

  - A lack of interest
  - "Human beings are very preoccupied individuals, they're caught in the momentum of everyday existence."
    - Everyone is caught up in putting out the fires of daily life
      - The fires in a relationship, the fires at work, the fires of what pleasure to satisfy next, the fire of why this person doesn't like me anymore

---

The truth is not a movement towards pleasure, the truth is a movement towards the absence of the need for pleasure"
    - All pleasure fades
    - Reality on the other hand never leaves you

---

"Losing your mind is precisely the path to sanity"
  - "Man is fundamentally a schizophrenic, and losing his mind is precisely the way out"
    - We hear thoughts all day long
    - We read into things that no one says
    - We see things that aren't there
    - We believe we're someone we're not

---

"Validation is the road to hell"
    - "The need for validation stops when you are satisfied by the purity behind the words that you speak, when that satisfaction is enough and does not need to be supported by any extra validation from anyone else"

---

Man is concerned that others are not interested in his feelings.

However, all the problems in his life arise from his pathological concern about his own feelings.

---

Nether the devil

Nor the people of the world

Nor the wrath of nature itself . . .

Can lay a finger upon the man,

Who needs nothing from anyone.

Not even himself.

---

What imprisons a man most

Is not the reliability of the "bad"

But the possibility of the "good."

---

If I cannot have it Forever

I do not want it for a single Moment.

---

None of society’s tenets are Truths**.

**What is the proof for this?**

**The proof is that these tenets cannot stand alone.**

**Each tenet requires its counterpart.**

**A fix cannot survive without the problem it is trying to mend.**

**If the problem dies, the fix dies as well.**

**That which cannot stand on its own two feet, unreliant upon any element or authority, is Untruth.**

**Truth needs no support**.

---

A Master is always the same

Without trying to be.

For he has seen The Truth behind all things

And thus, does not succumb to the chase for happiness or pleasure.

---

It is wise to incessantly examine and observe in search of The Truth.

But any firm "conclusion" that one makes from his observations

Will be incomplete and premature.

---

He who harbors no demands

Attracts no problems.

---

No one in your life will understand you

The ones who say they do are doing their best to “compassionately pretend.”

---

There is nothing wrong or improper about playing the silly little games you play with yourself

There is nothing bad about living a lie

The problems begin

When you think you shouldn’t be.

---

A prayer for the Ignorant:

Dear god, please bless me. And give me this and that.

A prayer for the Wise:

Dear Universe, allow me to see with crystal clarity how Hope sets me up for an inevitable fall.

And allow me to see the monumental cost of living a life of Need.

---

The problem with Reward

Is that it feels good.

The problem with feeling good

Is that it is pleasurable.

The problem with pleasure

Is that man enjoys it beyond compare.

Thus, such a one is chained to hankering for a reward

And, therefore, he is doomed to a life of anxiety.

---

It is 100 times easier to accept that one is “doing it wrong”

Than it is to believe that the concept is a lie.

The spiritual and performance community knows this

It is their ace in the hole.

---

Information is imperfect to entirely false

If it arises from the impurity of personal motive.

Scientific papers are motivated by “publish or perish”

Magazines are motivated by sensationalism and sales

Truth has little market value

But massive value for the one who learns it.

---

What is the Meaning Of Life?

Life is not a puzzle to be solved

It is an essence to be Accessed.

It is accessible by the One

Who arrives at the realization

That the person who is asking this question

Does not, in truth, exist.

---

All anger directed at oneself

Is mock outrage.

---

Among the most sincere and effective actions

Is to put on a clean white shirt and pressed pants,

Draw the curtains and turn off the phone,

Sit on the floor in the corner of a dark and quiet room,

And ask oneself,

“What is it that I Really Want?”

---

The selfish recluse obsessed with achieving self realization

Benefits the world infinitely more

Than the “selfless” philanthropist obsessed with charitable deeds.

---

Among the greatest of all Superpowers

Is the immunity to Pleasure.

---

A Herculean Power

A Transformative human milestone:

Arriving at the place

In which one no longer has to answer to their Mind.

---

If a man discovers Truth

In any form

In any domain,

He must realize that any discussions about it

Will only serve to separate him from it.

The world will not understand.

The man of Truth must walk alone.

---

Learn from the stillness of Trees

Learn from the grace of the gliding Cloud

Learn from the freedom of the flowing Stream

Learn from the naturalness of a bird in flight.

Nature has settled into an Arrival.

He who abandons all his chases

Does precisely the same.

---

The things that we understand, create Silence

The things that we do not, create Emotion.

---

A gentleman I just met passionately urged me to help the world and improve generations

It is natural to believe that if humans are “helped,” they transform.

The Truth is, rare is the human who seeks to be separated from the comfort and familiarity of his illusions.

---

No human in the history of the world

Has ever failed because they did not have the necessary “know-how”

Or because they lacked sufficient luck or opportunity.

They failed because they did not have the Requisite Desire.

---

The end of Involuntary Thought

Is Everything.

It is the Truth that summarizes all Truths.

But rare is the man who is ready for the fantastical thoughts and dreams of his life

To come to an end.

For this would create

And end to his own existence.

---

Wherever a man sees a train of Pleasure,

He buys a ticket and hops aboard.

These trains have numerous convenient pick-up locations

But they all go to the same destination:

The edge of a cliff.

---

It is a transformative milestone in a human being’s life

When he no longer looks forward to anything

Nor succumbs to despair.

When the things that once excited or disappointed him

Have lost their power over him.

When bright colors

Fade into pale pastels.

---

The Master observes.

Not for practice or austerity

Nor for improvement or “spirituality.”

He observes in order to see with total clarity,

The futility of it all.

---

What is a human being’s greatest burden?

A desire for that which he currently does not possess

And cannot guarantee to possess in the near future.

---

The man who, by any possible means, arrives at a place of:

“I am unconcerned with the way that I feel. Be it high or low, pleasant or unpleasant. For I have learned that such feelings are whims of a wayward mind, beyond my control”

Is a man who can never be touched by anxiety.

---

What is a human being’s greatest fear?

Feeling in a way he does not wish to feel.

---

The Vision must be created with delicate and painstaking precision

It is only then that one is in a position to ruthlessly eliminate anything and everything that does not move one toward it.

---

"When the good’s no longer shine bright

And the bad’s no longer create concern

Something fundamental changes within a man

He becomes Available to Truth.

He now possesses the time and space to see what he has never before seen"

- The Purity Of Action

(A Private Discourse)

---

It is never about “working”

It is all about The Work.

The glory lies in the Creation

The bliss lies in the Engagement.

For after all the riches have been amassed

And the applause has faded into oblivion

The Purity of the creation

Is all a man truly has.

---

If a man exposes his Mind solely to the things he wants it to imbibe,

If he engineers his every action in order to allow his Mind to record only the things he wants it to play back to him,

He will have created his interior Environment precisely to his specifications.

---

A Question for he who seeks a Life Of Satisfaction:

What is that Truth

That upon having seen it,

The desiring machine that is the Mind

Will come to an immediate halt.

---

Few men come to realize

That their entire life

Has been lived inside their Mind.

---

Every fortuitous event

Comes with a catch.

Every promise

Contains an asterix.

The wise man comes to see that there is nothing to look forward to in this life.

What lies immediately before him

Is the only thing he can trust

And the only thing there is.

---

It is nether wrong nor right to tend to the needs of the body

It is, however, worthy to consider that this body that commands a man’s attention and devotion for his entire life

Is, even for the eternal optimist,

Headed toward a permanent grave.

---

A man’s ultimate Freedom

Lies in a total indifference

To the way he is treated.

---

"The reason that one makes an effort is in order to chase or to flee.

And because chasing and fleeing are reactive actions, they are not Truth

They harbor an ulterior motive

Thus, they are doomed to fail."

- The Myth Of Effort

---

Humans tend to be at their worst in the home environment

For that is where they are the most Attached.

---

The greatest preparation for life

Is to eliminate meaning and significance from all things.

---

A Pure Journey

To the pinnacle of the greatest mountain

Can only be made Alone.

For in the company of one’s peers,

A man suffers the distractions of comparison and competition

And, in so doing,

Wastes precious years

Precious talents

And precious possibilities.

---

The man who is desperate to arrive at The Truth

With a blatant disregard for his opinions,

Lives a uniquely extraordinary life

And becomes privy to what few men ever come to know.

---

The Truth is a path away from all doctrines

All practices

All austerities

All rituals

All beliefs

All penances

All hope

All striving

All spiritualities

These are made to appease the masses.

The Truth is for the man who is desperate for IT

Rather than "the way" to IT.

---

Freedom

Lies in freedom from the notion

That there is something to attain.

---

"Only the one who has recognized the insignificance of a thing can pursue it in a manner that is serious

Only the one who has recognized the insignificance of a thing can pursue it in Freedom without turmoil."

---

The man who seeks to Arrive

By one manner or another, Arrives.

The man who does not truly seek to Arrive,

"Works hard."

---

Society has told you a romantic lie

You do not have to "work for it"

Or "pay your dues."

You simply have to know the Backdoor Path that takes you there.

---

The meditator is no different from the hedonist

The health nut is no different from the junk-food nut

Man is a pleasure-chaser

How ever he categorizes his chase.

He chases experiences

And calls it "progress."

He who loses his taste for pleasure

Is the one who truly Arrives

---

Self-blame is as futile as self-love

The latter is but a reaction to the former.

One's behavior is a natural consequence of his level of understanding, at any given moment in his life.

Realizing this, one moves away from the imprisoning concepts of good and evil.

---

A thing that is debated

Or institutionalized

Or celebrated

Or worshipped

Is seen only in name and form.

A Truth that is truly seen

Is seen quietly

Without excitement or celebration.

Like a leaf that quietly falls

In the dark of an ordinary night.

---

Quiet realizations

That are abandoned the moment they are heard,

Allow the seed to penetrate without the flash and pomp of the rind.

And are prevented from ballooning into significance

Within the theater of the Mind.

---

There is nothing quite so satisfying

As allowing one's eyes to see only Wisdom

And allowing one's ears to hear only Wisdom

For the Mind becomes saturated in the waters in which it is continually immersed

One becomes that which he continually sees, hears, and speaks.

---

Accept not

Deny not

And yours will be a life untroubled

---

The pitfalls of life are strategically placed

In order to trap the man who proudly pretends to know what he is doing.

---

Tomorrow, next month, or next year

May move in your favor, or against.

But one thing is for certain:

You will wreck yourself hoping for it.

---

Truth is far less accessible to the spiritual and the religious

Than to the heathen and the atheist.

---

There is nothing quite so satisfying

As allowing one's eyes to see only Wisdom

And allowing one's ears to hear only Wisdom

For the Mind becomes saturated in the waters in which it is continually immersed

One becomes that which he continually sees, hears, and speaks.

---

There is not a single pursuit in a man's life

That is not a procrastination.

---

Isolation from the world

Is a natural effect

Of those in whom Understanding begins to dawn.

---

"The Present Moment" is discovered

By the one who has seen with his very own eyes

The Cliff . . . at the end of every "path."

---

The man who asks "How," is the one who does not care to know.

The man who seeks "debate and discussion" is the one who seeks to show what he knows.

---

Man cannot bring himself to objectively examine what truly it is that he does in any 24-hour period

For this is the sort of shame that is best left unknown.

---

Objectively examining one's life

The serious man comes to the conclusion that each and every thought he has 

Is about "himself"

Of things and people that are "his"

Of things "he" would like to have

And ways he would like to "feel."

There is Nothing other than this.

---

If a man were held hostage for a year

Not allowed to think about "himself"

Not allowed to think about "others"

Not allowed to seek pleasure

And not allowed to seek "self-improvement"

What would he think?

What would he do?

(A question for yourself. Not seeking responses).

---

Whether or not your child speaks to you or respects you, or if you are adored or ridiculed by the world matters not. 

For even if all was just as you liked it, you would feel temporary pleasure, followed by permanent dissatisfaction.

Thus, Nothing matters

And All is for naught

---

Perhaps a life of Anonymity

Ruthlessly preserved

Is the truest and most effective life of all.

---

"Man must come to the understanding that there is no pursuit, achievement, or activity in existence that will satiate the human heart

And that there is no amount of book knowledge in the world that will satisfy his thirst."

- FILLING A LIFE OF TIME

(A Private Discourse)

---

If a serious man objectively examines his life, he discovers that his entire life has been a series of lies, empty promises, prescription chases, and fleeing this and that.

If sincerity lives anywhere within him, he will understand that he must Arrive 

Before death arrives.

---

The world is chasing "mindfulness."**

**But Truth lies in Mindlessness.**

---

Examine the nature of your thoughts

And you will discover that they are always in search of a dose of pleasure.

Circumstances that you would like to go your way

And situations that did not.

This is your entire experience of life

There is nothing else.

---

The results an individual receives are not a function of what he “does”

They are a function of what he is convinced of.

---

When reading The Private Discourses

Allow not your mind to turn them into a prescription.

---

The thing that can easily consume you for the rest of your life is The Thing

All else is done for empty pleasure

And this Forever leaves one . . . empty.

---

FINDING TRUE PEACE IN YOUR LIFE

No "working on yourself"

No "prescriptions"

No "exercises"

No "meditation"

No "spirituality"

No "forgiveness, apologies, gratitude, journaling, or love yourself"

Simply, The Truth.

---

A man is beginning to learn the Truth about life

When he is no longer surprised by anything.

---

A man’s most urgent necessity

Is neither happiness or money.

It is Wisdom.

For it is wisdom that he will need to navigate the turbulent waters of his day to day existence

Without succumbing to the ocean of turmoils

Or to the empty road of prescriptions.

---

It is easy to lose one's way in this society

Making oneself immune to the temptations of the Mind is more devastatingly critical than it has ever been.

---

The problem with Reward  
Is that it feels good.  
The problem with feeling good  
Is that it is pleasurable.  
The problem with pleasure  
Is that man enjoys it beyond compare.  
Thus, such a one is chained to hankering for a reward 
And, therefore, he is doomed to a life of anxiety.

---

The Simple Secret To Acquiring Genuine Wisdom:

He who has learned to view every situation 

Without the lens of "himself" or the "other"

Will find himself on the path to genuine wisdom.

---

The one thing that we, as humans, cannot afford

Is the incessant burden of Ourself.

---

Having an opinion,

A man will hold onto it.

Having held onto it,

He will become it.

Having become his opinion,

He will live forever in conflict

With the world

And himself.

---

Give not advice to your children

Give not help to your fellow man.

For wisdom lies not in Giving,

But in understanding the nature of human beings.

Keep all things to yourself,

Until the sincerity of the one standing before you

Leaves you no choice but to Give.

---

The single, discontinuous moment

Is all there is.

Memory haphazardly links them into an imaginary saga that one comes to know as “his life.”

---

**It is for this reason that the wise man lives the life of a recluse.**
 
**It is for this reason that the wise man speaks to very few human beings.**
 
**For there is only so much Truth that a societal man can bear.**
 
**How many layers of himself can he afford to burn?**
 
**How much of his life is he willing to admit is a lie?**
 
**How much of the house that he has spent his entire life building, is he willing to take a bulldozer to?**
 
**How many sacred cows can he condemn to the chopping block?**
 
**It is simply . . . too much.**
 
---

What most greatly contributes to a man's struggles

What blinds him to The Truth

Is the shadow of his own ego.

Not because it states that he is grand

But because it states that he exists at all.

---


All teachers and coaches

In all domains

Succumb to giving prescriptions.

For if they do not,

They will have no students.

Thus, there is no effective teaching

And no effective student.

It is all, in the end,

A pretending.

A shameless waste of a human life.

---

The wise man speaks not to others
For this is fueled by a need to express one’s opinions
The wise man speaks not to himself  
For this is fueled by a belief in one’s opinions.  
If there is no opinion to propogate  
One naturally comes upon Silence.

---

From Twitter to Instagram  
From the tarnished bumpers of automobiles to the prettified lips of human beings  
The world is awash in:  
Do “X” and you will become “Y.”  
No intentional “X” ever leads to a natural “Y”  
This is the Truth that modern civilization has yet to discover.

---

When there is clarity within

The outside world appears clear.

When there is turmoil within

The outside world appears tumultuous.

What one sees externally

Is a reflection of where one is internally.

---

The choices of human beings cannot be attributed to them

For humans are not in control of their lives.

Their impulses, their compulsions, and their addictions

Choose FOR them.

Trying to overcome involuntary thought 

Or attain wisdom 

Or achieve enlightenment 

Is frankly disingenuous.

For this is simply a re-orientation of the pleasure-seeking mind away from societal materialism

Toward “spiritual” materialism.

When innocence reveals itself as the only way to make it through life, unscathed

You will lose all interest in the intellect.

---

He who lives in the shadows

Beneath the surface

Never showing his chest

Or daring to demonstrate his significance,

Attracts not the attention of the demons of misfortune.

Such a man eases through life

Unnoticed

And unscathed.

---

Volition is untruth

For it arises from the intentions of a Self.

---

That which is hard, is dead.

That which is intentional, is egoic.

That which is conclusive, is clever.

That which is formless, is innocent.

That which is nameless, is pure.

That which arises from non-thought is Truth.

---

The thing that one truly desires

Is the thing he finds himself doing.

---

Siddha Secret: GUARANTEEING SUCCESS

Experimentation guided solely by outcomes.

Devoid of all beliefs and opinions.

Closing off the mind from the world, and from one's own hopes.

The natural absence of happiness or despair.

---

Siddha Secret: ACHIEVING THE IMPOSSIBLE

Why does man not achieve The Ultimate?

Because for his entire life, what he has been exposed to are the failures of himself

And to the status quo of the culture that surrounds him.

He fails, because his Mind has been trained to fail.

---

The fool attempts to win through “competing”

The Master quietly sets all the conditions in his favor.

---

When a man turns his attention to himself,

He sees only problems.

This is because in the world of the self, everything is insufficient, and everything incomplete.

If a man resolved never to turn his attention to himself,

He would forever be free of problems.

---

A Place To Begin:

It is perhaps wise to ask little of Life and its People

To live as a gentle and inconspicuous human who is here for a short while

Weaves in and out of the lives of a few,

Asks nothing from them

Then one day,

Quietly retreats into the beyond.

---

The visceral and fearless realization

That a man's days are numbered,

That he is, in fact, going to die,

Is the single greatest shield

Against the slings and arrows of life.

---

Siddha Secret: Arriving At The Goal

A destination, having been willfully established

And rooted in the Mind,

Must then be forgotten.

The Arrival at this destination

Results from a devotional allegiance to the conditions

That will result in its inevitability.

---

It takes an enormous number of years

For a human to realize the limitations of "technique" and "data,"

And arrive at the conclusion

That all outcomes arise from the Mind.

Even the one who says "it is all in the Mind"

Does not yet truly understand

That it is all in the Mind.

---

Freedom is the conclusive understanding

That all things in one’s life

From the mundane to the sacred

Are temporary.

---

Siddha Secret: The Highest Of Heights

Man can achieve unimaginable heights

When there is no interference.

There is no interference

When there is no significance.

---

A technique is not something that you "practice"

A technique is not something that you are "taught."

A technique is something that you Find within yourself.

---

There are many things to learn

But very little to teach.

---

If the external circumstances of a man's life were exactly as he wished them to be,

He would indeed enjoy a dose of pleasure.

But this pleasure would soon give way to dissatisfaction.

Recognizing this,

One sees that external circumstances have little to offer him.

---

Any change that is the result of a Prescribed Action

Will change back.

---

A man spends his life attempting to impress another

For he seeks validation.

He seeks validation

Because he is not enough.

He is not enough

Because a “self” can never be enough.

---

The desire to “help”

Has the effect of

“Dumbing down” the Truth

And prescribing a technique or a method.

As such, the aim of “helping” is aimed at replacing “bad” feelings with “good” ones.

True Help lies not in providing relief

But in the freedom from having to seek it.

---

If one seeks to mend any problem or situation,

There is no harm in doing what he feels compelled to do

Or in saying what he feels compelled to say.

The possibility of harm arises

When he is convinced that it will work.

---

Unless a man's life has a known deadline

He will waste it.

---

All things are Mental

But they are not psychological.

---

All that we fear

And desire

And chase

And celebrate

And lament

Are not matters of our own creation.

They are but a habit of a Mind,

That has not only manufactured the searches

But the very seeker himself.

---

The desire to change the world is neither noble nor effective.

It is but a clever escape

And a welcome respite . . .

From peering into the murky depths of oneself.

---

Every conscious thought

Regardless of its content

Is the Mind's ingenious trap

To keep the human "thinking."

---

The man who objectively examines his life

Discovers that it is centered around a great lie.

---

All talk has become “small talk”

For human interaction is a game of concealment and showmanship.

---

Should a man who is obsessed

Allow himself to become in the least way civilized

He is doomed.

---

Let it be known

That those who give you Prescriptions, Methods, and Hacks

For success, spirituality, self-development, or building empires

Are the silent enemy in your midst.

They are the reason you have been "searching" for your entire life

Without ever having Found.

---

The greatest societal skill

Lies in conquering the need to be liked.

(By You)

---

Humans do Silly Things:

They go to a "school" in order to survive in the real world.

They are instructed about enlightenment from an instructor who himself has not attained it.

They practice things that have resulted in nothing but failure.

They tell children to focus on "good grades," when such a thing has no practical relevance

They discuss the quickest traffic routes to arrive at a job they do not enjoy

They do everything based upon tradition, prescription, and habit, without ever examining the Evidence.

They believe that this message applies to someone other than themselves.

---

The Most Sincere and Intelligent Man in the World

Is the one who closes the door,

And places upon the table,

All the ways in which he has been stupid

In which he has wasted his life

In which he has gone on empty goose chases

And in which he has been lying to himself.

---

The very instant that I get the feeling that a person is needing to be "convinced"

The conversation is finished.

---

Do you know for a fact that what you are doing is Effective?

Do you know for a fact that what you are doing will take you to your goal?

How do you know without a shadow of a doubt?

How ever your Mind responds to this

Will:

1) Be Defensive

2) Take you away from the Questions

---

"This too shall pass?"

Yes.

But it will soon be replaced by another "This."

---

There is so much that a human does not understand

Any conclusion he makes is bound to be incomplete.

Mistrusting his own opinions

Is a natural movement toward Wisdom.

---

All forms of media

No matter how lofty or intellectual

Are an entertainment.

No matter the purity of the listener's intention

No matter the number of notes that he takes

He is attempting to battle an internal default

Which is not affected by external causes.

---

Mental models

Loss aversion

Occam's razor

Probabilistic thinking

Second-Order thinking

Gaussian distribution.

Man is an escapist.

The instinctive fear that he knows nothing,

Compels him to manufacture Academic and Intellectual concepts

To camouflage his insecurities.

---

Every human interaction,

From the smallest to the largest,

Is an attempt to display one's ego.

The ego of the "Knower"

The ego of the "Good Student"

**The ego of the "Learned Reader"**

**The ego of the "Helper."**

**If ego was banned**

**Humans would stop interacting altogether.**

---

**Every social gathering**

**Is a Twelve-Step Meeting in disguise.**

---


It is critical to Understand,

That one's spouse, children, parents, friends, colleagues, and priest

May do things for him, and have good intentions at heart.

**But they will, forever and always,**

**Prioritize themselves over any other.**

This Truth can set one Free.

---

The man who is charitable and benevolent

Is infinitely more attracted to the intoxicating feeling

**Of maintaining a self-image of "being Benevolent."**

Than he is to the Effects of his benevolence.

---

A man who is busy making Conclusions

Becomes blind to the Evidence.

---

Words of a Wise Man:

The first third of my life, I thought IT was "There"

Having not arrived at IT,

The second third of my life was a resentment against those who told me IT was "There."

In this final third of my life, I see that it was my need to "follow" that led me astray.

---

A morning talk with my younger son:

"If we operate according to The Truth", we flourish

If we operate against The Truth, we suffer

I will not give you Prescriptions.

As I told you when you were small,

It is my job to show you the room

It is your job to find your own corner."

---

He who takes Notes

Acquires very intelligent . . . Fingers.

---

The greatest Truth is,

I Do Not Know.

The greatest Lie is,

Feeling "humble" for having said it.

---

No man in human history

Genuinely Desired a particular thing

But waited for someone to tell them "how to get it."

---

Rain falls outside my window.

One could spend a lifetime examining it

For it is real, it is here, it is wet, and cold

One need not speculate about it

Or wonder if it exists

Or work toward it.

It is real, it is here

It is Truth

And thus worthy of one's time.

---

If intellectuals, having read their greek philosophy, buddhist literature, and scientific theories

Were banned from telling others about the knowledge they acquired,

They would lose interest.

There is nothing in modern culture or society

That is not squarely centered in Ego.

---

The path of striving and achievement leads only to endless frustration

Pure Mastery of craft and of Mind

Is the only sustainable joy and satisfaction.

---

Greatness

Arrival

Truth

Are by their very nature and essence,

A steady retreat from the world

And its people.

It is this very fact

That makes them so extraordinarily rare.

---

What is Perfection?

Non-interference.

---

A Serious man asks himself

What is it that I Know,

That contains not a TRACE of opinion or belief.

(Not an invitation for responses)

---

Seek not reciprocation from "people"

For there is nothing in this world to be gained from any person.

The credits one has attained through Sincere acts

Will be reciprocated by Nature.

---

The man who moves through life

Keeping his associations loose

With even those he professes to “love,”

Acquires the eyes 

To see things as they are.

---

A person who is wise in his teens

Will avoid other teens.

A person who is wise at any age

Will avoid groups of any kind.

---

Ego is suffering

Parenting is suffering

Relationships are suffering

Competition is suffering

Striving is suffering

Hope is suffering

Pleasure is suffering

Suffering is suffering

Life . . . is suffering.

Seeing that it cannot be otherwise

Frees one from suffering.

---

Boredom is a constant companion of the Super Successful

A critical thing to understand about boredom is that it has no permanent solution

For it is not a condition, but a sign.

A fish feels cold only when it is out of water

Man only feels boredom when he is out of the Moment.

---

Growing attached to family

One becomes complacent and careless.

In loosening emotional attachments

One becomes appreciative and graceful.

Truths:

Independence creates Freedom

Becoming strangers creates relations anew

That which one "owns," he destroys.

---

The waves on the open ocean

Are not beautiful.

They are Truth.

---

News, magazines, statistics, books, articles, television, radio, podcasts, instructors, coaches

Create messages for the widest possible audience

They cast wide nets to acquire popularity and “business”

They thus have no power to transform any unique single human being.

---

He who attempts to tame the ego

Acts from the very thing he seeks to tame.

If one is to move away from ego

Let him not proceed as one who seeks to slay a monster

But as one who has discovered that this is precisely what the ego has made him into.

---

“The things I have learned through direct experience are many. But they will not benefit you”

- Siddhartha Gautama

Should a man open his mouth to respond to what is not in his direct experience, he acts from empty intellect.

Quiet Exposure

Without compliance, or discussion.

---

The psychiatrist gives man a pill

The psychologist, counseling

The motivationalist tells him to act

The spiritualist tells him to meditate

No one has really heard this man

They have exiled him into therapeutic escapism

They have given him everything

Except The Truth.

---

One of the secrets of Life

Is to truly experience

The accessible Present,

Before it becomes

The inaccessible Past.

---

It is most wise and fruitful

To keep one’s dealings

Directly with Nature itself.

Rather than with its middle men

Known as human beings.

For nature knows what is in a man’s heart.

Sparing him

From a life of hope, need, and dependency

Upon the fickle heart of man.

---

If it creates excitement, it will collapse

If it creates anger, it will collapse

If it creates hope or need, it will collapse

If it relies upon reciprocation or specific action from another, it will collapse

If it creates freedom, dispassion, or indifference

It holds promise

---

Siddha Secret: Goals vs Visions

Setting realistic and achievable goals

Recruits the capabilities one currently possesses.

Creating an Insane Vision

Shocks one's Mind

Into creating capabilities that he did not possess only moments ago.

---

That which the ear hears

That which the eye sees

The Mind becomes.

A man is a product of his most consistent exposures.

---

The world,

The Mind,

Is but a cackling macaw.

Chasing blindly after pleasures

Gorging itself in endless thought

Prostrating in desperation at the feet of hope

Begging at the altar of happiness.

There is No One

There is Nothing.

---

To free oneself from problems

One must first free oneself from the fix.

---

In any problem of life

All that the Mind speaks

For you or against you,

Explaining it this way or that,

Has not any significance

Or Truth.

It is this

That one must come to understand.

---

Nothing marks a novice like “Certification.”

Authentic is for the Authentic.

The Master is for the one who must become a Master.

This world consists of cosmesis for those seeking cosmetics.

The Authentic man,

Finds no home in this world.


---

Central to the failure of humans to achieve Peace, Freedom, or Enlightenment is their uncompromising need to receive from, and depend upon, others.

Their frank incapability in entertaining any and all Truths that imply or hint at an Isolation from, or Indifference to, the world.

---

In any problem of life

All that the Mind speaks

For you or against you,

Explaining it this way or that,

Has not any significance

Or Truth.

It is this

That one must come to understand.

---

He who is devoted to Truth is ever cognizant of the way things are. He sees life's indifference to his preferences. He sees his beliefs being dismantled. He sees that he owns no one or nothing. He sees that all attachments have left him destitute.

Such a man, discovers Freedom.

---

For the man who Thinks:

Thought creates his life

It creates his stories

It creates his self-image

It keeps him in bound to a lifelong state of fixes and putting out fires.

It is the only existence

He will ever know.

---

How do I rid myself of problems?

You cannot.

Problems will live as long as you do. 

They will follow you on vacation. They will follow you to the restroom, the workplace, the bedroom, the temple, and the spiritual retreat.

Try as you might, you will never get rid of them.

---

There is No:

Right track/wrong track

Improvement

Progress

Failure

Success

Perseverance

Hard work

Positivity

Trending

Cap feathers

Trajectory

These are but things that humans have invented in order to make themselves feel good.

A man has Arrived

Or he has Not.

---

Rare and serious humans do exist in the world.

A seriousness that gives birth to a Question whose very formation begins to transform the questioner.

These have not surfaced today.

Perhaps next time . . .

---


One may do what he wishes. From the acceptable to the unthinkable.

If he does it to acquire happiness, or escape pain, he will be tormented by mind and conscience.

Try as he might, he will never convince himself or others of his goodness.

Truth lies in the absence of doership.

---


Nature would be wise to create a virus

That produces not fever or sickness

But a sudden loss of speech.

Not all the industrial pollution on earth

Can match the noise pollution of empty cacophonous human speech.

---


If there is a thing to become fearful of, it is the Self. 

The Self is a crucible of hardship, pain, evil, struggle, and endless confusion.

The cautionary tale of mankind.

To retreat from the Self, without the slightest pride or humility for having retreated from it

Is Truth.

---

The acceptability of suffering

Keeps one tied to suffering.

---

Penance, austerity, meditation, mindfulness, worship, prayer, chanting, and all forms of "practice"

Do not take one to wisdom, enlightenment, nirvana, or the beyond.

The evidence of millions is before you.

"Practice" is an ulterior motive.

Lacking purity, one does not Arrive.

---

An attempt to rise, stand tall, persevere, be heard, defeat, feel empowered, become a role model, exhibit male/female power, and be known

Are attempts at self-celebration.

Such things are not borne of Purity or Truth

They are borne of Insecurity.

---

The entirety of a man's life is viewed through the lens of emotion.

Emotion is built upon a foundation of thought.

Incessant thought is a product of attachment to a Self.

The self is an imaginary character created by the Mind.

Thus, a man's entire life

. . . is Untruth.

---

No "self-help" or "spiritualist"

Will understand this.

For their high horse, is much too high for reality.

And no one in the world will dare to say it.

In today's age,

The single most definitive marker of Seriousness and Sincerity

Is Money.

---


"Help humanity, create meditation apps, and change the world."

If Sincere, such a man may wish to ask:

From where does his desire to "help" truly arise?

Have smartphones enlightened human lives?

Has meditation given him nirvana?

What is this "world" that he seeks to change?

--- 

Man spends his entire existence, fighting for various freedoms within the corridors of his life.

His only true freedom

Is freedom from himself.

---

Feet planted firmly on the earth

No belief, opinion, attachment

No expectation or hope

A whole-hearted devotion of one’s life to Truth in a particular domain

Intimate relation with the unremarkable and dispassionate Moment.

This should lead to a pure Heart and a clear Mind.

---

If a human does not know Precisely where he desires to go,

His mind drifts towards empty intermediaries such as "working hard," "improvement," and "progress."

If a human knows Precisely where desires to go,

His only standard of judgment is

Has he yet Arrived?

Or has he not?

---

Need arises from a craving for pleasure.  
Craving for pleasure arises from the Mind.  
The Mind arises from an attachment to the self.  
Need, in all its forms,  Is the ultimate imprisonment of man.

---

Let a man discover the one true talent that nature has delicately entrusted to him.  
Let him devote this life he has been given to the full realization and maturation of this talent.  Becoming a Master in this one thing  
Will allow him to know all things.

---

Four important questions about your desires:  
1. What do I genuinely want?  
2. Why do I want it? Where’s this desire coming from?  
3. What will be the cost of achieving this desire?  
4. Am I ready to pay the price?

The realization that the cell phone provides no satisfaction.

The ability to sit,

Without meditating or thinking or doing or trying to self-improve.

The ability to become a nameless human organism without a history or a chase for pleasure.

This is Something

(And Nothing).

---

Freedom lies in seeing that every pursuit concocted by the mind is an attempt to adorn the self. To add a layer of significance to one's existence. In order to quell the suspicion that one's life may have no meaning. And that one may, in fact, have only ten years left to live.

---

In the present, the future is a fantastical dream

In the future, the past is a nostalgic memory

If one learned to catch glimpse of the present's subtle transition into the past,

He would live and view the present

With the same fondness

With which he views the past.

---

Let a man,

Speak not of what he himself has not experienced.

Tell others to do what he has not accomplished.

Seek from others what he cannot give to himself.

Find faults in others that he himself suffers from.

Pursue Truth, rather than give or receive.

---

A thing done out of benevolence, backfires.

A thing done out of selfishness, backfires.

That which occurs spontaneously,

Neither preceded nor followed by thought

Creates not a consequence in the human.

---

Smart, dumb, handsome, ugly, fit, unfit, successful, or unsuccessful . . .

Indifferent to what he thinks of himself

He will be unaffected by what others think of him.

Freedom from self-image

Is the ultimate freedom.

---

Whether one realizes it Tonight

Tomorrow

Or one thousand lifetimes from now . . .

The only way to peace in a human life

Is when involuntary thought comes to an end

And the only thing that one is humanly capable of experiencing

Is this Moment.

---

There is no rainy day to save for

There is no tomorrow to shelter one

There is no reason to play anything safe.

Whether one makes it all, or loses it all

The day will absolutely and most certainly come

When he leaves this earth forever.

One must See and Feel

While he can.

---

One fateful day, 

The wise man

Comes to this sparkling realization:

"My opinions are stupid

My beliefs are stupid

My knowledge is stupid

My thoughts are stupid

From now on, I will keep my mouth sealed

For I cannot afford to waste a single minute

Of the life I have left"

---


He who intricately aligns every facet of his life with Nature,

Has neither the use or the need

For meditation, spirituality, diet, or a “healthy lifestyle”

---


The pleasure of fame and wealth invariably fades.

The satisfaction of creating Art

With a wholehearted indifference

Invariably endures.

---


A human does not know Truth

Thus, he resorts to the concept of Right and Wrong.

He does not know who he truly is

Thus, he resorts to the concept of Good and Bad.

Truth lies not in the domain of Knowledge.

It lies in knowing

That one does not know.

---

The cleverest stronghold of the ego

Lies in the intention to liberate "others."

---

We do not realize what we have until it is gone

Thus, it is wise to dismiss all conclusions and opinions while we have it.

---


There is no greater Elixir

Than needing not

And caring not.

(About one's own self).

---

One says the same things, to the same people, in the same way, on similar days, as the same person, thinking the same thoughts, experiencing the same feelings, having the same fears, the same anxieties, trying the same prescriptions, getting the same results.

---

Aristotle Onassis: "My father told me to carry a notebook. And when I meet a man, write down how much time he is worth."

Truth.

All humans that a man spends his time fretting over, are not worth the time.

Ultimate Truth:

One stands before a mirror

And pulls out his notebook.

---

Epiphanies are not valued for the thing being realized

But for the excitement for having realized them.

Both are short-lived.

---


Social interactions create a sense of "happiness"

And leave one with a feeling of emptiness.


---

Be it self-realization or super-stardom,

All that is otherworldly

Arises from tragedy and suffering.

---

The Mysterious Machine:

To determine the Cause

That produces the Effect.

Having no interest in luck or good fortune

Determining first-hand, the inner workings of the Mysterious Machine

This cannot fail.

---

Tonight one is sitting in his home. Nothing special is happening. Sounds of dishes and voices. Thoughts of this and that running through the mind. Chores and minor anxieties racing through the veins.

Transformation begins Here.

---

If you have to chase it

You will never have it.

---

He who intricately aligns every facet of his life with Nature,

Has neither the use or the need

For meditation, spirituality, diet, or a “healthy lifestyle”

---

The thought of taking matters into one's own hands

Leads one to limitation and anxiety.

Things in life and nature

Happen of their own accord.

They are not the result of human effort and volition

As society has conditioned humans to believe,

But of a ripeness of conditions.

---


If one seeks to rise to the top of any field,

He will devote himself to convincing his heart and his mind

That the prevailing dogmas, methods, operations, and principles of that field

Are based entirely upon Untruth.

This is the doorway to the rarefied Pinnacle of any field.

---

Freedom

Is indifference to the mind's thoughts.

---

Man, in his conventional understanding of himself,

Is nothing.

His successes are not his.

His money does not truly belong to him.

His talents are not created by him.

All things are bestowed upon him by the Universe.

Through an unbroken chain

Of Cause and Effect.

---

Mind tells a man that he has improved. That he is more X and less Y than he used to be. It tells him that he needs to think this way and not that way. After all, the proper/good/right thing to do is X. Practice harder, get better, become more. Talking and talking and talking.

---

To like All

Creates no problems.

To dislike all

Creates no problems.

To like some

And dislike others

Creates a world of problems.

---

The true solution to any problem

Lies not in “solving” the problem,

But in Defining it.

---

Faced with stress,

The Mind moves moves in a consistent and predictable pattern for a given human being.

Once a human is made privy to his mind’s unique and particular pattern,

He is now able to exit the mind’s turmoil whenever he chooses.

- Siddha Scroll: Secrets of The Mind

---

“The reason that humans experience Anxiety

Is that the Mind literally manufactures it.

All anxiety-relief measures Excite the mind, by the very attempt to calm it. 

Causing the anxiety to establish permanent roots within the Mind”

- from Siddha Scrolls: Secrets Of The Mind

---

When one becomes perfectly certain

That there is nothing to be gained from anything or anyone in this world.

When this door, and all such possibilities, have been sealed shut,

Bliss overtakes a human being.

---

Uncompromise.

---

That which one refers to as Stability,

In the end,

Proves to be Imprisonment.

---

A person

Is nothing other than Mind, personified.

Happiness, unhappiness, pleasure, pain, like, dislike, being, non-being

Are but false notions it has come to imbibe.

It has no characteristics to improve,

None to shed.

It is a phantom,

Made flesh through misunderstanding.

---

"Confidence comes not through success, performance, results, or knowledge.

Sought in such ways, it flees soon after it arrives.

A confidence that is Permanent, is the only confidence worth having

And a man may be trained specifically to acquire it"

- Siddha Scroll: Confidence

---

To ordain as a monk, and live in a monastery is a theoretically fruitful proposition.

However, a mechanical performance of prescriptions and rituals do not create Transformation.

Alone with a Master

Or in Seclusion

Devoid of groups and prescriptions

Can Transform a human.

---

Teams at the highest level of sport, are coached with the lowest levels of understanding.

An understanding of the Mind, the source of performance, and the manner by which humans learn.

The One who understands this

Will be in the Rare position

To create an Unbeatable franchise

---

Truth and mind at mutually exclusive 

---

The man who sings with eyes closed

Walks aimlessly in the rain

Becomes the things that he sees

Oblivious to any and all,

Is no more.

Such a man has disappeared.

Truth is all that remains.

---

There is so much in this life to Realize.

So many powers to uncover.

So many Secrets to become privy to.

There is no happiness, glee, or spirituality to any such things.

Visceral, black and white Powers

That compose the substance of Man.

---

No significance

Spawns Freedom

From all limits.

---

When, after many years, a human being arrives at Seriousness and Sincerity,

His most thunderous realization is that there is no place in the world that he will find a path or people

That are Not mired in prescription and ritual,

Nor wholly devoted to Truth.

He is Alone.

---

May man take solace in the fact

That neither he or any other human is fit to judge him.

His intentions and actions, from the subtle to the gross,

Will be judged by the Universe itself.

It . . . Knows.

---

Let a man extricate himself from the ilk of the masses

Let him drop his unserious methods, austerities, and prescriptions

Let him end the procrastination to see what he was meant to See in this life

Innocent and inspired,

Let him turn his gaze in the direction of Truth.

---

A human, though he may be the richest in the land,

Lives, fundamentally, a life of chores.

A life of putting out fires

A life of running from This, and chasing after That.

A human, though he may be the richest in the land,

Is a Slave.

A Slave of the Mind.

---

A man is all that is pure

And all that is evil.

He carries within him the salt and the soil of all things.

Realizing this, he may come to see

That if he is all things,

He cannot be one thing.

And being not one thing,

He is No-Thing at all.

---

Transformation is genuinely available to a serious human being.

Beyond anything he thought possible

Beyond anything he has ever experienced.

Not in the fleeting sense of happiness or pleasure,

But in seeing things with a crystal clarity

Beyond explanation or words.

---

A man becomes Limitless

When his devotion to discovering The Truth is high

And his desire for the pleasure of results is low.

---

One must be willing to lose everything

In order to see the Hidden Truths in any thing.

Truth is for the man whose sights are set on Permanence

With an utter disregard for fleeting short-term pleasures.

---

A man who has been searching for peace all his life

Finds himself afloat beneath a capsized ship in the cold, dark Atlantic.

Upon discovering an air pocket,

He finds the peace he has been seeking.

Peace is found

In the geometric center

Of unending storms.

---

Freedom lies not in feeling free

It lies in the genuine indifference to how one feels.

---

Let it be known

That be it a person or a thing

The more you care

The more you need,

The greater your Attachment

And the greater will be your Suffering.

---

Human beings approach ethereal states such as No-Mind

Through the vehicle of fMRI, EEG, data points, conferences, and science.

Nature does not allow its most rarefied elixirs to be captured in test tubes.

In order to own it

One must prove himself worthy to receive it.

---

He who likes nothing

Dislikes nothing

Hopes for nothing

Laments nothing

Accepts nothing

Rejects nothing

Is the man who walks through walls

And passes easily through all of life's storms.

Wherever he may go in this world

His mind remains clear

His heart remains free.

---

The attachments forged yesterday

The needs created today

Will bring you to your knees tomorrow.

---

Rain can only soak one who is dry

Pain can only hurt one who craves pleasure

Turmoil can only affect one who craves peace

Conflict can only harm one who craves harmony

Mud can only soil one who is clean.

The one who craves Nothing

Can be harmed by Nothing.

---

Kind, lazy, mean, courageous, cowardly, moral, strong, resilient, intelligent . . .

Are labels nowhere to be found in the domain of Truth.

A human thinks and feels many things,

Thus, acts in many ways.

Thought, feeling, and action

Moreso happen To Him

Than arise From Him.

---

Expectation

Spawns comparison.

Comparison

Spawns anxiety.

Anxiety

Spawns a chase.

A chase

Spawns more chases.

---

Questions Tonight:

The Serious Man recognizes

That his time on this earth has almost come due

He has not an hour to waste on the games of the Mind.

You may ask

If you wish

Namaste.

---

The Truth is that a man is going to die. As he sleeps in the night. As he moves through is daily routines. As he plans for the future. Death is moving toward him at lightning speed.

Whether all is well, or unwell,

All that he truly has

Are these moments

Before his death.

---

Nature fails not to thwart

Any and all things

Done for the purposes of validation or praise.

The uncompromising purity of one's pursuits

Are the only thing a man will ever have.

---

Living homeless

In the wind and the cold

On pavement rough and firm

Is certainly not easy.

But it just might be easier

Than living a life

Doing what one does not like, worrying about money, living in conflicting relationships, in a monotonous domesticity.

---

Every human being lives forever upon an invisible cusp.

He lives inches away from learning a Truth

That will in that very instant

Transform his life

Alter his life trajectory

And consume him with inspiration and direction.

---

Siddha Secret: Ultimate Performance

Performance is a side effect.

Pursued as a goal, it vanishes.

---

In this life,

Nothing truly belongs to a man.

Not his family or children

Not his money or land

Not the clothes on his back

Or the sandals on his feet.

All is on loan by grace of the Universe.

A gateway to Freedom . . .

---

A Man Of Truth

Must first understand his nature.

Then, rise above it.

---

Throughout much of a man's life, he is trapped in the illusions of interpersonal relations.

If clarity dawns, he comes to the realization that the person whom he has been chasing and running from all along, is also the only one he must ever learn to live with:

Himself.

---

The man who by no choice of his own

Is driven to become a Legend.

Will likely not have been given the DNA

Or the availability in spirit and constitution

For perfecting the delicate mathematics of human relationships.

---

A man may, if he so wishes, spend his life searching for Answers.

Truth lives in Questions.

---

Truth lives in the domain of No Thought.

In this domain,

A human becomes a Being.

He rises above all things.

Most of all,

The wholly limited, struggling, and groping patchwork of a creature

He has come to know as . . . himself.

---

Humans attach to other humans

As a way to further attach to their own identities.

The greatest human Freedom

Is the freedom from all things

And from all people.

Which, at its very essence,

Is the Freedom from one's own identity.

---

Life provides sunshine and storms

Truth lies in being indifferent to both.

---

When a man is young, he tries to please his parents

When he gets married, he tries to please his spouse

When he becomes a father, he tries to please his children

When he grows old, he tries to please god.

One day, he comes to discover

That his life has never been his own.

---

As you stand at the precipice of this life,

Understand this before entering:

Set your eyes upon the mystery of nature and its beings,

And you will reap an unimaginable reward.

Set your heart upon them,

And you will pay an unfathomable price.

---

Smartphone addicts

Do not become Legends.

If Tiger Woods was raised in the era of smartphones

The world would never have heard of him.

---

A man spends 84 years in wait

For moments that total 37 hours in happiness, reward, vindication, acknowledgment, and pleasure.

---

No one thinks about you in quite the way you think

No one will love you in the way that you hope

No one can give you what you have always longed for

No one will make you what you seek to become.

To Lean

Is to Fall.

---

The Moment

Is man’s only true refuge

From chaos and sorrow.

---

There are things that you do not know

Which if you came to know them

Would categorically transform your earthly existence.

---

Man becomes so preoccupied with his problems, that he can no longer live without them.

If he is not finding a solution to his problem, he feels something is amiss.

When problems become a man's friend

And searching for solutions becomes his friend

He lives as his own enemy.

---

If you are respected or not

If fortune has given to you or has not

If life is painful or not,

It is neither good or bad.

There is no one to forgive

And nothing to fix.

Raw Truth is the only thing there is.

There is nothing to say about it,

Nothing to think about it.

---

Man craves validation from the world,

The adoration of his children

And for things to be the way he hoped, or the way they once were.

Even if he had them, they would not satisfy him.

All cravings lead to nothing.

For Nothing

Is all a man will ever truly have.

---

All that excites a man

Loses its shine.

All that pains him

Loses its grip.

All things arise from insignificance.

And to insignificance they return.

---

Society has sold you the greatest of lies

That the goal of life is to become “happy.”

This one chase

Has cost you your life.

---

All the happiness in the world

All the good fortune on earth

Compares not

To a Mind that has come upon silence.

---

What could a human being achieve

If he was not addicted to smart phones

Was not societally conditioned to socialize

And did not allow any form of interference in his daily existence.

Pursuing this Question

Would not be a wasted life.

--- 

In your life, you have carried out shades of good

And shades of evil.

Paying a price untold for both.

Though you may spend every single moment, from this day to that,

You will never satiate the Mind's interrogations.

For the Mind has not the capacity

To make you whole.

---

From the perspective of the Mind,

Every life is a difficult life.

From the perspective of Truth,

There is no chronological "life" at all.

---

Siddha Secret: Clarity vs Doubt

If one is driven by the hope of reward

And the pleasure of favorable outcomes,

He will be stricken by self-doubt.

If he is at all times self-honest about the purity of his motivations,

His decisions and his actions will arise from Clarity.

---

As a man awakens from slumber,

Let him not assess the state of his life.

Let his mind drift neither toward his good fortunes nor his grievances.

His true existence lies in the single breath, the single step.

His freedom lies beyond the saga and the story

Known as “his life.”

---

What is

Is.

It is not wise to impress this upon yourself.

But simply to let it go where it goes.

---

In searching for what he does not have,

Man sacrifices what he does have.

In examining what he has,

He looks in the direction of people and things.

And in doing so fails to see

Who he is without them.

---

No matter how bright the sparkle,

All things in this life eventually lose their shine.

---

Relationships,

Be they between wood and steel in a building

Or between human beings in society,

Begin to fail,

When one object/human places an undue need or demand upon another.

Truth lies in carrying the weight of one’s life

Upon his own shoulders.

---

If a man needs no one to like him, agree with him, praise him, validate him, forgive him, acknowledge him, invite him, or accept him,

If he is indifferent to the winds of circumstance

And to the hand of fortune . . .

Such a man floats through life,

Free of all burdens.

---

The greatest temptation of a leader or a parent

Proves also to be his costliest mistake:

To say or to do a thing

Simply because he can.

---

He who is of a rare sort

Whose eyes drift toward the heavens,

Who harbors a nature considered unsuitable for this world,

Will see the emptiness of society,

And the shallowness of the ways of men.

So that he may make wise use of this one life

And die not an ignorant death.

---

Practitioners waste their lives

Working hard at the game.

A Master devotes his life

To understanding it.

---

Truth lies in man's discovery

Of his genuine motivations.

Do his actions arise from ego?

Or to fill a hole within himself?

Or for a morsel of pleasure?

Discovering his true motivations,

Without rules or judgments,

He becomes mature.

And gains the respect of the Universe.


---

Severing attachments to the Self

Benefits a man infinitely more

Than the attempts to improve it.

---

All the money in the world

Is but a pittance

Compared to a Mind that has become free of involuntary thought.

---

All that surrounds a man

From the plant on the window sill

To the furniture on the hardwood floor

Is perfectly still, care free, unencumbered, and indifferent.

All that surrounds a man is Enlightened.

Except for the man himself.

---

Devote not your life to becoming good, humble, and self-improved.

For these are but an adornment of self-image.

Seek rather to:

Discover the empty chases that bind you

Discover the needs that imprison you

Discover the holes you ask a hapless society to fulfill within you.

---

There is no such thing as a day.

There is only a Moment.

There is no such thing as a life.

There is only . . .

A Moment.

---

What truly satisfies?

Money loses its luster, fame grows cumbersome, accolades become trite, success becomes empty.

One must genuinely examine what provides him lasting satisfaction.

This is a place to begin.

---

The sun is melting into the sea.

Was it a good day?

A bad day?

Did you improve today?

Or stay the same?

Abc?

Xyz?

The sun is melting into the sea.

---

Creating attachments with the people of the world . . .

It is not that one should or should not

It is arriving repeatedly at a dead end and eventually coming to the realization that no matter how promising the next human "attachment" seems . . .

It can only ever be a dead end.

---

Rely upon yourself. Teach yourself. Accompany yourself. Have talks with yourself. Scold yourself. Commiserate with yourself. Work with yourself. Create art yourself. Inspire yourself. Take long walks with yourself. See yourself. Know yourself.

Seek No Other Human in this world!

---

A human views traditional life as something that he will mold into happiness and harmony. A puzzle which will one day fit together. And good intentions bring good results.

The Truth is that life is ruthless, unpredictable, unfathomable.

And in many ways, unfit for human beings.

---

In a respectable world,

Quality would make a thing popular. Giving would beget receiving. Kindness would beget appreciation.

The Truth is,

Blockbusters and best-sellers are of the lowest quality. Giving results in entitlement. Kindness gets taken advantage of.

---

There occurs a transformational shift in a man's life

When he arrives at the realization

That events and circumstances in life occur not through relationships with other humans,

But through a relationship with the Universe.

---

It is of no utility or value to speak with 99.999 percent of people in this world.

For the only human that has the capability of speaking Truth,

Whether it comes in the form of guidance or conversation,

Is the one who has freed himself from opinion and belief.

---

Examining the frivolities of one's chases, habits, and actions,

The Serious Man arrives at the understanding

That whether he is in the home, the workplace, on an airplane, or the terrace,

The only worthwhile pursuit in every minute of his life

Is conquering his Mind.

---

Live in a modest house at the edge of the sea

Limit association with human beings

Seek not friendship or attachment

Speak little about yourself

Avoid groups and political parties

Become attuned to the whispers of instinct

Seek freedom

Devote your life to The Truth.

---

Mind seeks association

Mind seeks socialization

Mind seeks discussion and debate

Mind seeks attention and validation

For Mind is the world, internalized.

---

If you embarrass yourself,

The people in front of whom you became embarrassed are nobodies.

These nobodies will tell other nobodies,

About the embarrassing episode

Of a Nobody.

---

PEACE:

To think nothing of anyone

Including oneself.

To create neither friend or foe.

To ask nothing from the hand of fortune.

To understand that all things are an Effect of a Cause.

To quietly devote oneself to creating the Cause, without hope or chase.

---

Imagine never once for the remainder of your life

Second-guessing yourself ever again.

This is one small side effect

Of conquering the Mind.

---

A man may be given the permission to ask himself:

Abandoning temporarily the thought of all logistics,

How is it that he wishes to spend his time.

How is it that he wishes to spend his life.

From this permission

From this freedom

Truth may arise.

---

Every pleasure that you chase today

Will not arrive

Or will not last.

A reorientation toward that which lasts

Is the secret to lasting satisfaction.

---

Beware of people

Beware of yourself.

---

A man says to himself,

The years that have been wasted

The pains that have been endured

Wanting things to be a certain way.

Perhaps it has been enough . . .

---

 Under the constant influence of society,

Man is taught to run, to practice, and to do.

Intensely preoccupied by trying to progress and to improve.

How does it benefit a man to chase lofty ideals and fanciful prescriptions,

Without ever even coming to know

Who he truly is.

---

The wisest man,

The strongest man,

Is not the one who moves through life ready to face any challenge,

Overcome hardship,

Or defeat his enemy.

It is he who rests in a genuine understanding that he does not know what life will bring.

And greets it with Silence and Dispassion.

---

A man may make acquaintances

But in his heart, keep humans at arms length.

Let him place his trust in,

And keep not a breath of distance from,

The Universe.

For it is the only relationship in his life

That will never fail him.

---

A man who is going to live forever

Has risks and consequences.

A man who is going to die

Has none.

---

A man spends his life seeking fortune, and avoiding misfortune.

Seeking pleasure, and avoiding pain.

Living under this burden,

It is all misfortune.

It is all pain.

---

Life turns on a dime.

In ways that no man can predict.

Be it good, bad, or indifferent. 

We awake one day to find ourselves in a place we never imagined

And we begin to stop living under the illusion

That our life is under our control.

---

Truth is the only thing that nourishes a man.

If a man has no consistent and protected haven of Truth

His life is a lie.

He will live his entire life subject to the assaults of circumstance, enslaved to the Mind.

That to which one is most consistently exposed,

He Becomes.

---

Things come to a man

When he needs them not.

Trying not to need them

Is needing them still.

---

No sense of place

No sense of self

Light seen as light

Sound, as sound.

A return to a primordial being.

Away from the noise of the world,

And the accumulated confusions

Of the Mind.

---

Truth is not what you say you will do

It is not what you decide to do

It is not what you actually do.

Truth is what you find yourself doing.

---

The Game does not begin with the whistle on the field.

It begins when the sun rises

And the feet touch the floor.

---

Man's actions are guided by Fear

In the cloak of Desire.

---

There is not a single moment in the day

That your Mind is not hunting for pleasure.

Upon reading these words,

It will think to stop this.

Which is a hunt for the pleasure to stop chasing pleasure.

Then you will ask, What Then Shall I Do?

Yet another hunt for pleasure . . .

---

Hard work, toil, practice, repetition, instruction, striving, hope . . .

The stuff of Mules.

Inspiration

Vision

Longing

Thirst

Hunger

Salivation

Devotion

Purity

Immersion

Truth

Transform the physiology, the heart, and the blood of the organism.

The stuff of Legends.

---

The trouble with man is that he is forever on the run.

Forever attempting to get somewhere.

Wherever a man desires to go,

He can only go from where he is.

Truth, therefore, lies not in discovering where he seeks to go.

But first, in discovering where he currently is.

---

You may have done hurtful things

For which you are burdened with guilt.

You may have done helpful things

For which you are filled with pride.

Truth lies in understanding

That where there is one,

There must be the other.

Truth lies not IN things

It is BEYOND all things.

---

Intelligence lies in recognizing one's own ignorance.

Wisdom lies in the indifference to the pride of this realization.

Truth lies in the indifference to self-image.

---

The True Question is not

How do I become happy?

The True Question is . . .

What is it that is worth Devoting My Life To.

---

A man seeks respect from his peers

Validation from the world

Love from his family

Fortune from fate

Mercy from god . . .

Under the weight of such hope

Under the burden of such demands,

Fear and anxiety become his constant companion.

And Freedom,

A mirage in the distance.

---

Truth lies in becoming . . . 

Story-less.

---

The wisest and most successful man in the land

Secures that which prevents him from wasting this one precious life:

A Person or a Force

That protects him from himself.

---

Life is not linear.

The Self is not Truth.

One’s identity, story, and place in the world is not solid.

One’s circumstances are unpredictable.

One’s relationships with others is founded upon need and attachment.

Not realizing this, is the source of all human anxieties.

---

Your greatest problem is one you are not yet ready to understand.

It is your unending desire to feel good.

Your ceaseless pursuit of happiness.

Antithetical in every way, it goes against everything you have ever known.

Nonetheless, it is the very core of all your problems.


Understand if you are sincere,

That this society is a flea-market with neon lights.

It is for the pleasure-hound and the drunkard.

It sells empty prescriptions for those who seek the illusion of progress.

Every man who has ever found Truth,

Has divorced himself from society.

---

It is unconscionable to tell a man to be more compassionate, kind, or hard-working.

Whatever a man is at a given moment, he is.

Realizing his qualities and flaws

Is Truth.

Beginning from Here, something is possible.

Beginning from where he is not, nothing is possible.

---

A man’s only currency in this life

Is how he Feels on a permanent basis.

Pleasure is fleeting, thus, a non-solution.

Permanent peace/bliss/equanimity comes from Conquering the Mind.

What in a man’s life, could be more urgent than this?

---

Man lives a distracted life.

Distracted by technologies

By pleasure chases

By his needs in relationship

By the winds of circumstance . . .

That which is True

Is the thing that he misses.

He misses it

Because he is distracted by the idea of Himself.

---

To do something because it is "good"

Or because it is "right"

Is a fruitless chase,

A manufactured societal tenet.

In Nature,

There is only Cause and Effect.

In Nature,

There is only Truth.

Man is not society.

He is Nature.

---

He who knows life

Accepts not the lows

And trusts not the highs.

---

A man who has not Clarity of Mind

Has nothing.

---

# THE DESIRE TO PLEASE OTHERS

What must be understood

Is that one does not try to please others for the "other."

He attempts to please others

So that he may be seen in a favorable light.


All of a man's actions

Are a play for reward.

Performed on a stage

In the name of Self-Image.

Namaste.

--- 

The day that it strikes one

In the deepest chambers of his heart

That he is completely Alone in this world,

Is a seminal day in his life.

As the fog of emotional upheaval begins to lift,

A profound Seriousness and Clarity begins to arise within him.

---

The person whom you've imagined to find

Your entire life

Does not exist.

(Feel free to keep searching).

---

The Mind of man is personal.

Life . . .

is impersonal.

---

Man is held together

By a patchwork of hopes, needs, beliefs, and opinions.

It is for this reason that he is forever fractured.

It is for this reason

That he lives forever on the verge of collapse.

---

In seeking from others

In seeking from circumstance

There is only suffering.

As hope, in its every shape and form,

Is suffering.

---

The nature, the trajectory, the experience

Of your life,

Is determined not by what happens To you.

But by what happens Within you.

---

There must be urgency

Something precious to lose

A precipice of catastrophe

The threat of armageddon

The edge of a cliff

An 11th hour . . .

Without such things there is complacency.

There is distraction.

There is an "eventually."

An idle rotting under a hot summer sun.

---

Virtually Everything in your life

Is a chase.

Virtually Everything in your life

Is unserious.

This message will Reach only

The Serious man.

---

You seek spirituality, self-help, retreats, healthy habits, austerities, practices, and makeovers

Because you see an infinite horizon.

Because you adopt the luxury of Time.

You have settled into a foreign land.

You have made a house

Out of that which is not your True Home.

---

Nature has created a self-sufficient mechanism

In creating a human being.

If the being is wronged, he can give, and become free.

He need only act solely from his end

The rewards also come on his end.

Ingeniously created

To never require “another.”

---

Attaining wisdom

Learning the True nature of people and things

Becoming serious

Seeing the plain untruth that is attachment

Seeing behind the chase called happiness

Seeing the imprisoning needs of relationship

A life devotion to discovering The Moment

And The Truth.

---

The Legend

Takes great and delicate pains

To expose his Mind to exquisitely particular things.

For this greatly determines his altitude.

Thus, he surrounds himself

Not by yes-men, experts, or coaches.

But by those who have found The Truth.

---

A man may have all the wealth in the kingdom

But if he has not conquered his Mind

He is a slave.

---

People speak in "bumper-sticker" language.

When things are well, they chant love all; all is one; this too shall pass

They frolic in unseriousness when the seas are calm.

When the storms arrive,

Bashed and battered,

All is silent,

With no bumper-stickers to be found.

---

The sadness of sorrow is Real

The pain of pain is Real

The bite of anxiety is Real.

Life is serious business!

The Serious man has no time whatsoever

For the carnival of spirituality, self-help, motivation, therapy, or psychopharmaceuticals.

---

At this very moment

You are Distracted.

---

Seek The Truth

In every situation

In every relationship.

Honesty, without assumption, judgment, or opinion

Prevents decades of misunderstanding

And actions based upon this misunderstanding.

Humans have a tendency

To live false lives.

---

Before you became a mother, a father, a brother, a son, a daughter, a wife, or a husband

You were Something.

Discovering the nature of this Something

Before it became a “someone”

Is to discover Truth.

---

Siddha Secret: What A Man Becomes

A person says he wishes to be this and that.

But what he Truly desires

Is that which he is at that moment.

If he did not desire that

It is certain that he would not have become it.


Every human being,

In one form or another,

Is living in a grand and multidimensional Compromise.

---

Learning requires Payment

In all forms.

The more valuable the lesson

The more costly it tends to be.

---

 It is not about seeking correctness

It is not about seeking solutions.

It is about learning the path

To an Inspired State Of Being.

Floating upon such a cloud

Lifts one above the banalities

And problems

Of his life.

---

What science, religion, medicine, and spirituality has not yet realized

Is that mental and emotional problems

And quite possibly all pathologies that occur within a Human Organism

Are the result of Involuntary Thought.

---

Conquest lies not in strength

But in Indifference.

---

Within a man there are many lies.

His Freedom lies in the arrival of a genuine desire

To quietly search for The Truth

If it is the last thing he does in his time on Earth.

---

What is it that you are looking for, a man asked.

"I do not know, he responded.

But I will know it when I see it."

The Mind knows only ideas.

The Heart has the capacity to See and to Recognize.

---

You waste time

You waste your life

Because you have the luxury to do so.

---

A world class performance

Is a Side Effect of specific things.

The key is to understand and train those specific things.

Those things are Never in the realm of “method or technique”

They are in the realm of learning where Results truly reside.

---

The Secret to Creating An Enduring Masterpiece:

1) This begins with a special Question
2) This question, once asked, makes the mind go silent
3) Like a shark that is rolled onto its back
4) The mind has now been turned in on itself
5) Thought ceases
6) And Creation awakens

---

Every self-image

Is a Limitation.

---

Belief.

Opinion.

The greatest barriers to Truth.

---

Those to whom you are attached

Are those from whom you will forever seek validation.

---

For those whom you have helped:

You may receive credit and appreciation for your noble efforts

Or you may not.

Whether you do or not,

The pleasure of that appreciation is short-lived

And thus not worthy of the anticipation.

Emotional needs

Have very low yield.

---

The Journey to true living

Is the Journey of giving oneself up.

---

It is not difficult for me to give a man Truth.

For Truth, in its raw and complete form, can indeed be given.

The difficulty lies in him acquiring the ability to imbibe it.

---

Let a man err more than anyone in the land.

But let him not be False.

---

Discover not your passion.

Discover, rather

Your Gift.

---

An indescribable Freedom it is

To need nothing

From Anyone.

---

A man who has not Desperation

Has Nothing.

---

TRUTH:

"You can't imagine how intensely I was living

How good it is to be on your own

You climb up and you look back at your boat

There is the sea, the wind, the sound of the water.

On your own, you can discover who you really are."

- Bernard Moitessier

---

Your entire life is a bombardment of messages.

Do this, do that.

Become this, become that.

Be more of this, be less of that.

Practice this, practice that . . .

Amidst all of your doings,

Amidst all of your becomings,

Death will snatch you

In mid-stride.

---

You meditated?

Well done.

Did your 20 min of mindfulness?

Bravo.

Consumed less carbs?

Marvelous.

More healthy, more happy?

Splendid.

Questions:

Where will you cash in these chips?

Which god is going to give you credit for such things?

What have they Really gotten you?

---

Humans have reduced their lives to checking boxes.

Triglycerides

20 min of meditation

Exercise

They eat food made in laboratories

They live their life according to fears and rules

Right, good, healthy, positive

A forced and plastic existence.

They Miss

Their entire Life.

---

Why would a man seek Life Extension

Unless he first discovered the secret to a Free and Peaceful Life?

Why would one seek to "extend"

A life of anxiety?

If he discovered Peace and Freedom within himself

It would not matter to him whether he lived for One Year

Or a hundred.

---

The Quality of a man's Life

Is inversely proportional

To the number of Lies that exist

Within his brain, his heart, and his Mind.

---

Finance

Fitness

Performance

Enlightenment

Agriculture

Infectious Disease

Diet and Physiology . .

In any discipline in the modern world

There is but ONE HUMAN who knows The Truth,

Because he has devoted his Life to it.

Unless you have found HIM

You are paying for Lies.

---

A SACRED BELIEF THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS TRUE, BUT THAT HAS COMPLETELY RUINED YOUR LIFE

Belief.

(In Anything).

---

Societally-sanctioned Oxymorons:

Life Coach.

Art Instructor.

---

A game of any kind

Can only be truly enjoyed

If one is not attached to a particular result.

This is not difficult to achieve

For the one who recognizes

That his knowledge too limited

To know the outcome

That will ultimately benefit him most.

---

If one is obsessed by The Truth

He eventually comes to discover

That all industries,

From fitness to finance

From self-help to spirituality,

Are entirely founded

Upon a Lie.

---

Your problem is not your enemy.

Your problem

Is that you have Friends

And Enemies.

---

The accumulation of life events.

The accumulation of feelings about the events.

As the memories grow,

The Mind becomes . . . heavier.

The human begins to buckle under the weight.

For he was not made to withstand

The Weight of Memories.

---

An Enlightened human

Is not the one who is Good.

He is the one who has gotten over the idea of "goodness."

---

The most Powerful man in the land

Cultivates not strength,

But Innocence.

---

---

An impatient longing

For Permanence.

Not for the beginning of a new pleasure.

But to reach The End

Of all a man's concerns.

---

Modernity,

In all its varied forms,

Leads to the dissolution of the human species.

---

When No One is home,

One is always At Home.

---

Society and its band of instructors

Tell you what you "should do."

The Truth lies in

what Must Happen.

---

A man is What he is.

He is Where he is.

Whatever he is

Wherever he is,

If no desire to be something other,

If no celebration of who/where he is,

He is in a place of Truth.

(Not to be celebrated)

---

All things arrive

When one needs them not.

They arrive, when he is not searching for them.

The phone rings, when it is not being watched.

After one receives,

After the phone rings,

The pleasure fades.

He returns to needing.

Nature returns to giving

Once his need fades.

---

Wisdom lies in seeking Understanding

Rather than betterment.

---

Where there is no like, or dislike

Where there is no opinion

Where there is neither hope, nor fear

Where there is neither This, or That

There is Nothing.

Where there is Nothing

There is only the infinite expanse

Of Truth.

---

The Student, prepares for life

The Master, prepares for death.

---

Of what use will this Life have been

If one does not find Truth.

How can a man find Truth

If he does not devote his Life to it.

How can he devote his Life to it

If his heart, his spleen, his liver do not long for it.

---

To sincerely seek The End of all things

Is the True Beginning

Of a man’s Life.

---

Thing do not "get better."

They stay the same, in different ways.

---

You have been told of monkey mind.

Methodologies you have been given, such as meditation, mindfulness and various others

Do not cure monkey mind.

Before asking "what to do"

Recognizing this fact, as verified by your own experience

Must become a visceral understanding.

---

Nature has plans for a human.

The human has his own.

Freedom lies in a genuine indifference

To both.

---

Discussions and debates ride upon a foundation of ego.

A luxurious expression of dearly-held beliefs and opinions, rather than a quiet and sincere movement toward Truth.

All beliefs, all opinions, and all conclusions

Are a celebration of ego

And a flee from Truth.

---

Seek not "the best."

Seek The Only.

---

The traditional way is always Untruth

The majority view is always Untruth

The "certified" instructor is always Untruth

This stands to reason

For the humans it comprises are not Devoted to Truth.

Truth is always from the Beyond

Truth is always

From Wild and Untamed Humans.

---

The desire to attract the eyes of the world

Wholly incapacitates

The blossoming of The Art.

---

You will spend many decades upon this Earth.

In all of this time, you would be greatly fortunate to encounter but One person who is Rare and truly Serious/Sincere.

This provides a great Freedom.

The Freedom from worrying about what anyone thinks.

For all but One

Is worth it.

---

The world could applaud you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for all your life.

It would not be enough to satisfy you.

You could perform penance and spiritual/self-help prescriptions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

It would not be enough to make you Realized or Free.

---

Is This the way it always will be?

This is This

Because That is That.

This is not altered through This.

It is altered through That.

The alteration occurs of its own accord

When This

Is no longer bearable.


---

The Perfectly lived life, is not of happiness

But of Emptiness.

---

Siddha Secret: Greatness

Greatness

Resides not in the X's and the O's.

Resides not in the form and the technique.

Resides not in aphorism and psychology.

Greatness resides

In the Devotion.

Greatness resides

In the true desire to learn the cracked code of The Mind.

---

What would be the nature of your daily existence, if your actions were not motivated by pleasure.

This is a Question that a Serious Human may wish to consider.

---

Village lives

Sun and moon-centered lives

Farming lives

Are pure and natural forms of living.

---

Every field that you have a vested interest in

From finance to medicine to performance to homebuilding

Has ONE Brilliant Genius.

Who has escaped the lies of his industry.

And will give you The Truth.

Scour the world to find Him.

Why would you possibly settle for less?

---

All of life's Elixirs are available to a Human.

But through Devotion

Rather than prescription.

---

It is a Joy to aid the Serious.

To provide for them a Haven

In a world that has forsaken them

And caters to the unserious.

---

If a man attempts to force himself

To become Serious

To become Sincere

This is Untruth.

To Arrive at the Truths of life

To Arrive at a command over the Majesty of the Mind

To Arrive at anything Otherworldly

Is theoretically available to All

But Practically, to the Few.

---

There is no time.

There is no time.

There is no time.

There is no time.

There is no time.

Understand . . . 

There is no time.

---

You are not worthy of condemnation.

No matter who you are

No matter what you have done.

All things revert to an equilibrium.

---

 Either a man has Arrived

Or he has not.

There is no "progress."

---

Only a fool

Is proud of his accomplishments.

---

Patience is a virtue

Of the Unserious.

---

It is all about the journey, not the destination:

For he who seeks improvement, rather than Arrival.

---

The problem is Not that society has lied to you.

For barking dogs and laughing hyenas know no better.

The problem is that you have imbibed the lies so completely

That you do not recognize them

As a problem.

---

There may be ONE Human in the entire Twitter universe

Who is truly Ready for the messages released in this account.

(If you have already begun trying to figure out who that ONE is, this is proof positive that it is not you).

---

The Wise man does not tempt life

With either excitement or pride.

---

The purgatory between what IS

And what he would like it to be

Through desire

Or guilt.

This is the life of a human being.

---

What humans have done IN the world

Is inspiring.

What humans have done TO the world

Is frightening.

---

World Class comes not from hard work.

But from a Sincere desire

To be World Class.

---

A Sincere Human

Must arrive at the Truth as to whether he longs for Freedom or Pain.

---

When losing Everything becomes acceptable,

Gaining Everything becomes possible.

---

Gazing through a window

Into glistening trees, and distant shadows.

The entire episode that comprises a man's "life"

Is created is housed within The Mind.

There is no man's "life"

There is no "man."

There are only . . .

Glistening trees

And distant shadows.

---

All of a man's problems

Can come to an end this very evening.

This is the power

Of the Truth.


The Thought-less state . . .

---

Pure.

Uncompromise.

Spontaneous flash.

Channeling.

Raw.

Absolute.

Divine.

Thought-less.

TRUTH.

---

Problems:

Answers perpetuate them.

Truth solves them.

---

Things that begin Pure

Invariably become commercialized, certified, diluted, and bastardized

Until neither the purity, or the effectiveness, remains.

Truly Rare Gems

Preserve their Purity at all costs.

A shining Beacon on a Hill

In the flea-market of commerce.

---

Whatever a man seeks to achieve in his life

There is a Specific Truth that guarantees that particular achievement.

---

To genuinely not know

Is a genuine Beginning.

---

Human association

Invariably leads to pain.

---

Truth.

Total Freedom.

An End to all pain.

Is a practical and attainable reality

In this very lifetime.

For the one who weeps for Truth

And vomits at the sight of prescriptions.

May these words reach

The One.

---

We do not truly see what we Have

Until memories reveal

What we Had.


Our personalities

Have robbed us of our lives.


How can a man who has glimpsed a drop of The Truth

Possibly stand "tall and proud."


Wise is he

Who sees just how deeply he has been consumed

By nonsense.


The only way that a man can know what no man has ever known

Is if he seeks what no man has ever sought.

---

The deeper a man’s longing for Freedom and Truth

The more impatient, and the more receptive, he will be to learn their true source.

---

Man's problem is not that he is unhappy

His problem is that the propensity to Chase, the addiction to Opinion, and the habit of Prescription

Are overwhelmingly more attractive to him

Than never-ending Peace.

The Truth is there are but a small handful of humans on Twitter

Who will genuinely benefit from the words that appear on this account.

The remainder have the birthright to do so

But ego, belief, a lack of self-honesty, and a need for validation

Incapacitate this birthright.

---

Humans are not accustomed to being spoken-to as Humans.

They are accustomed to being spoken to as invalids in need of cheering up, and being improved.

---

When a man enters the front door

Awakens from slumber

Or breaks from work

His Mind and his Limbs race toward a particular Thing.

Whatever this Thing may be for a particular human

This is his True Allegiance

Whatever his lips may say.

---

A man hires, associates with, and recruits

Precisely those activities and humans

That support his disingenuousness

And thrive within his set of insecurities.

---

There is nothing more joyous to the lips, than speaking Truth.

And nothing more painful to the ears, than hearing it.

---

A few select humans are Transforming.

Seeing through eyes that have opened for the first time in their lives.

This is not a reason for excitement.

They are not "good" for having done so.

Simply a Quiet Effect

Of exposure to Truth.

---

A moment not lived in Freedom

Is a dead segment of life.

---

The war worth fighting

Is the war against one’s Insincerity.

---

If one seeks No Limitations

He must first have No Excuses.

---

Do not settle in

Do not grow roots

Do not create attachments

Do not covet money and things.

For your time in this foreign land

Is soon to be over.

---

Only Untruth

Can be Commercial.

---

All roles that a human plays

No matter how sanctified and ostensibly sacred they may be

Produce only anxiety and failure.

This is because

Every role is a Lie.

--- 

There are maybe a few hundred to a few thousand Humans in the entire world population

Who are Ready to receive The Truth.

---

Virtually all Humans lie to themselves every moment of the day and night

This is perfectly acceptable to them.

---

Spirituality, pooja, satsang, retreats, religions, austerities, and self-help

Are mass entertainments.

---

The attempt to “help” any human

Arises from ego

And ends in futility.

---

There is no greater fool

Than the one who chases happiness.

There is no greater idiot

Than the one who attempts to find it in society and its people.

---

Look at what society and your “circle”

Has done to you.

---

He who has “faith” in humanity

Need only speak to the first ten people he meets in the street, or on Twitter.

Or the first hundred

Or thousand

Or million

Or hundred million

Or billion . . .

---

This world has nothing to offer.

Its people are predictable and uninspiring.

Circumstances are circular and joyless.

A cacophony of voices and noises.

A traveling circus of cardboard props and neon lights.

This world

Has nothing to offer

The Sincere and Serious human.

---

Truth lies in seeing the emptiness behind all pursuits

The fraudulence of “helpers”

The impotence of methods

The ashes that manufacture self image.

---

Strangers make more peaceful companions

Than acquaintances.

---

You will never be happy.

One cannot be something

That does not fundamentally exist.

---

Life, it must be known,

Is capable of things one cannot imagine.

Placing one’s trust in it

Is a catastrophe in the making.

---

WHAT ARE YOU DOING

Examine what you are doing.

So habitual you have become,

That you do not examine.

See what you are doing.

It WILL surprise you.

---

A man's opinions are nonsense.

His beliefs are nonsense.

His thoughts are nonsense.

His entire life settles and moves upon the foundation of this nonsense.

A Sincere man

Grows tired of his very own voice.

---

The reason that you are not Silent

Is because you are under the insidious notion

That you know something.

---

The human who Sees the hopeless irreversibility of his conditioning

And the depths of his artificiality and ignorance

May live to escape it.

---

He who attempts to make you happy

Perpetuates your suffering.

---

Moderation is a lie sold to the masses.

Truth

Lives in the Extremes.

---

The most damaging addiction

Is Hope.

---

The insincere and ignorant pursue "improvement" and "feeling better."

The Sincere and the Wise pursue Truth.

---

For you who speak empty platitudes, reply with bumper-sticker quotes, happiness, be strong, love/love/love, all is one, be this, do that . . .

I wonder if your drivel ever stops you in mid-speech.

If you ever feel the tinge of shame for your unseriousness.

Responses allowed.

---

A man's life is entirely wasted in the pursuit of being viewed as

Good

and

Smart.

---

Every person in your life

Is hindering you

In ways that you will never come to know.

---

A Summary Of Man's Life:

Babble nonsense to nobodies.

Pleasure chase for rewards.

Adorn his ego.

Ingest intoxicating substances.

Practice self-help techniques.

Have conflicts with self and others.

Have an unrestful sleep.

Wake up, repeat.

Die in mid-action.

---

In a TRUE world,

The Unserious human

The Insincere human

Would be a pariah.

A shunned and ignored and marginalized faction.

In the world we currently live,

He is the centerpiece,

The one who is catered-to,

And this is why this society breeds

More of "them."

---

Every effort

Moves one further from Truth and Transformation.

---

The trouble with being around “people”

Is that one develops a need for them.

---

Man succumbs to death but once.

To Life, he succumbs each and every day.

---

Everything is genuinely possible for you.

But your opinions and beliefs exempt you from this possibility.

---

There is not a person on this Earth

That will be as reliable as you would like them to be.

---

You will tend to like another

More than they like you.

---

Each excitement

Has a cost.

---

The more faith you place in humans

The harder you will fall.

---

On your way home, after speaking in a group setting

You feel a tinge of embarrassment for what you said

And the bite of fear for how you may have been perceived.

---

No matter how promisingly different a particular person seems to be

They, sooner or later, turn out to be like all the rest.

---

After all these years, you find that your life has become

Something you could not have possibly imagined.

---

You long endlessly

For the fateful day that happiness finds you.

---

You feel completely alone.

You do everything possible to convince yourself that it is not true.

---

The Obscure long for the future.

The Famous yearn for the past.

---

Never in your life

Have you ever been Enough.

---

You are intimately tied to the belief

That tomorrow will be better than today.

---

You make excuses for those who do not reciprocate

Because the alternative is not something you are ready to bare.

---

There is no Divinity

In personhood.

---

 A human lives so many lies.

So many fractures he is manually holding together.

---

Every human being in your life judges you in some way

Is unreliable to you in some way

Hurts you in some way.

Every. Single. One.

What this demonstrates is not that humans are “bad.”

But that a “human” cannot be your faith, fulcrum, or foundation.
